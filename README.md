**Archive For the NYC Yoga Studios Archive - A CUNY Project**
NYC Yoga Studios Archive was primarily built using a paid Omeka Classic subscription due to its affordability and general ease of use. The project XML files are available for download on the project’s GitHub site and are completely rebuildable with a subscription to Omeka Classic, an administrator account and potentially the installation of the Omeka CSV import plugin. The project’s individual items and their collections hold all quantifiable data and interactive resources. Final versions of the XML and contributor data will be published in late 2024 to the GitHub’s site. The Wordpress blog that hosts research, maps and data on yoga will stay online indefinitely. No images or extensive data were included as part of the final export of CSV and XML but are available upon request.
