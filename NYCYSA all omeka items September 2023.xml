&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;My quick origin story, I am originally from Long Island. I've lived in the city for the last several years, many, many years. I went to college in the city and I kind of stayed here since. I work for a nonprofit. I work in the field of mental health, and I also teach a couple yoga classes. Oh, fun fact, I have three dogs who you hear in the background wrestling. It was kind of like a Brady Bunch situation when my partner and I moved in together. So I brought two dogs to the relationship and he brought one so I have a 13 year old Pitbull named Vita. We have a nine year old Pitbull named Jack's and a six year old Australian shepherd named Zag. So I'm almost like a little embarrassed to say but my foray into yoga was as a high school student. As a junior I was invited. This is like so embarrassing. I was invited to the prom as junior with my senior boyfriend at the time. And all of the girls who were trying to like lose weight. We're going to take Bikram yoga classes. So I went to Bikram a couple times and I actually like maybe with the like, kind of unhealthy way that I was like trying to lose weight at the classes. I was like, Oh, this is really cool. Like, I grew up playing sports. I played soccer for most of my life. We played field hockey in high school a little bit. And I really liked that yoga was like athletic, but also like, quiet. I have a very noisy brain. So I connected very strongly with that anyway, so I continued to practice, kind of on and off. Throughout college, I didn't really have like a home base per se, but like, you know, I joined the student center when I was in college, and I would always have yoga classes, I went to Fordham University for College in the Bronx. And like, as every kind of broke college kid was doing at that time was also going to Yoga to the People controversy. But anyway, I graduated in 2014, and moved home briefly to Long Island. And there was a great little studio there called Yogananda, which unfortunately does not exist anymore. But it was right down the street from my parents house. And I started going there because I just like, needed something to do. And I really loved the community, I loved the classes, I loved the I loved all of it, I was very, I mean, I jumped in with both feet. So that was in 2014, when I kind of like, began more of what I would say like a regular practice. Moved back to the city in like 2015-2016 and kind of bounced around between different studios in Brooklyn, like Goodyoga at the time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  3:03  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And in like 2017-2018 is when I found Kula, actually kind of going back. The original way that I found out about Kula was my very first job out of college, I worked for a showroom briefly, that did like wholesale. Buying for, like different accounts. I know, it was like sales, for one of the brands that they manage was Manduka, like the yoga mats. And when I was working there, it was when they were coming out with our first line of clothing. So it's very exciting. But anyway, so we would go to studios that stocked Manduka products and like, meet the teachers and take the classes there and like, buy like they would buy the products. And anyway, so that was how I like kind of became more involved in like the yoga scene in New York City. Like I was going into studios like House of Jai, which also doesn't exist anymore, very sad and Yoga Maya, which also just recently reopened. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  4:04 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Anyway, so when I started practicing at Kula was in like 2017-2018. And I completely like fell in love with the studio with all of the teachers with the style of yoga that they teach there. And that became kind of like my home base. And in 2020, is when I did my yoga teacher training there. So we started the teacher training in January pre shutdown. And the first nine days of the training was so magical because it was like an intensive so we were at the studio all day, for like nine days in a row. And then it was like, a like every other weekend type thing for a couple of months. But then obviously like in March, everything shut down. So we wrapped up the training on Zoom. And here we are today. It was just so I mean like, I don't know, sometimes I still don't have the language, I feel like to fully like capture what it was, like live through that experience of just like COVID. But, um, yeah, I mean, these were people that I had I had spent so much time with. So I really looked forward to having those meetings on Zoom and still like meeting as a teacher training group, because it was so like, that experience of being a teacher training with other individuals is so like, so many things, and so intense. And then to like, have to kind of immediately transition to this fully not spending time with each other in person type situation, very, like traumatic in a way. So suffice to say, I really looked forward to having classes and meetings on Zoom, because I was missing that community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  5:54 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I think everybody has taken classes online with Yoga with Adriene on YouTube. So I definitely had taken some classes online, but it was not really my thing. Like I really enjoy going to the studio, I think that they were doing the best that they can with the information that they had at the time. And there were some, maybe modules that I felt more like, Oh, this is really like, not making me feel like I'm missing out on anything. And then like some other ones, where I might like have the teacher training on but also like be baking, you know? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  6:27  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I did not teach classes. So when we finished the teacher training, um, I felt very, like, a little bit disillusioned because I had no frame of reference. Like to be a yoga teacher under like, normal circumstances. You come out of teacher training, you're feeling so many things. Like you're so excited, and like, they have all this information that. And like, I should say that, like, when I started the teacher training, I wasn't necessarily like, Oh, I'm going to be a yoga teacher, I just really loved Kula and practicing there and was like, I want to, like, see what this about. And kind of through that process was like, Okay, this is something that I also want people, um, but had not obviously taught in a studio, or to that point. So you know, being like a brand new baby yoga teacher, and like, dealing with the vicarious trauma of COVID, trying to, like, teach my friends and family on Zoom, and, like, feel good about what I was doing did was not something that felt good for me. I just felt like really unnatural. Like, I was playing a part, you know, um, I think and like, maybe fortunately, or unfortunately, like, I think the teachers that were successful online, were teachers that already had a following of students from studios. Which obviously was not anything that I had. So then, you know, it's like really kind of demoralizing, a little bit like for your ego. Which, like, it's not really about the ego. But I don't know, to feel like you want to do this thing so badly, and then have so many barriers in the way of like, being able to deliver that thing. I felt like, Okay, I don't know, like, what I'm actually doing and, or if I'm even going to actually pursue this ultimately. So I did not teach really at all in the year of 2020 When I finished my teacher training, like maybe every once in a while for like a friend, very small scale. But I took classes outdoors when people were offering like, socially distanced classes, I'm pretty sure they were in 2020. And I don't know it was definitely like a mix of feelings like wanting to be in that environment with other students so badly and like practicing with other bodies, but also being like so sketched out about COVID. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  8:59  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Um, it was definitely unprecedented times. It did not feel like a good time to me, I felt stressed and like I was trying too hard. If that makes sense. Um, which of course like the feedback I got was always like, Oh my gosh, that was so great. But I'm such a critic of myself. And like in the early days, I would be like, that was terrible. Um, so didn't feel great and I am not like a techy person by any means. There is no cute layout in my apartment to get like a good angle with like some plants and like good lighting like that does not exist in my apartment. So it never really took off for me 2020 COVID Teacher Training like land for me in a way that I felt like I was delivering something that felt like I would want to share it with others at that time. Um, did a lot of like reflection and like, you know, reconnecting to my practice myself. And then in 2021, when things started to like, open up a little bit more, I was like, Okay, we're doing this, like I didn't, I want to do this, I have to kind of infer myself if I want, like, you know, like, there is a seat for me at this table somewhere, and I am going to go find it. So, um, I started teaching at a few. Well, so originally started teaching at Stacked Yoga, she used to have a spot on Tompkins and then was like renting space or, like, teaching classes out of a spot on Nostrand. So I had a little audition and I started teaching a couple classes. I actually did teach a class outdoors for them a few times, there were a couple classes in Herbert Von King. And they were also doing classes during the Sunday street closure on Tompkins during Open Streets, and that was super fun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  11:03  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Like, I don't know, I, I have like, I still deal with this a lot. Like as a teacher, like I had a lot of impostor syndrome. When I first started, I really enjoyed it. So I was like, you know, you get a little taste, and you're like, Okay, I want to I want more. Um, so from there, I started teaching at some other studios in Brooklyn. And then in 2022, is when I started teaching at Kula, in the spring of 2022, I got my feet wet a little bit. And then I went back to the place that I did my training. And I was like, Okay, let's do this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  11:42  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;In like 2021, when I was like, regularly starting to teach classes at a studio in Brooklyn, the classes were both in person, and livestream all of the classes all of the time. I was not, not into it, but I found it. And this is something that I have, like worked on in like, in my teaching, that I like to deliver to folks. But I found it really difficult at first to like, be present with students in classroom and also students online. And I could not find a way to make that feel like I was giving both of them enough of myself to like, make it a great experience for both people. Because for a while, like, yes, the studios were slowly reopening, but it was still like kind of sketchy to be going to classes and I wore a mask for a while when I was teaching at first. I would take classes wearing I mean, we had to for a while. But like even beyond like when it was still kind of more optional. I was wearing a mask. Anyway, so I thought it was a great and like, interestingly enough, like when I was first starting out, like right after my teacher training, when I was trying to do Zoom, I would, I was like kind of like screw this, like I don't like doing this. But then getting into a studio and teaching classes in studio. It's like, oh, this is a wonderful. And like, I don't know why this person doesn't want to come in, like why dont they come take class? Like, it's amazing that you can find ways to take a live yoga class at your house. And a lot of the classes that I was teaching at that point, were both so it was something that I just sort of got used to. And now I am teaching a mix, I would say of classes that are live streamed and in person. And then just in person, I don't teach truly online. Like I know a lot of people will do like a personal like zoom class or whatever. I think that's amazing. I just didn't really connect to that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  13:53  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I still take classes online sometimes. Like sometimes it's just really hard to get to the studio and I'll throw on a class 45 minutes in my backyard if it's nice out or in my bedroom and I'll, I'll do my thing. And, um, yeah, I don't know, I mean, the whole mask thing. Um, I still wear a mask on the train. And sometimes I think like people are ready to like, just pretend this whole thing never happened. But like, on a fundamental level, like we're different. Um, but yeah, yeah, I remember having like, thoughts about masks in class, like, I mean, throughout in one class, like I could, like run the gamut of like, so many things that I felt about my mask like, Oh, this is so annoying. Like, Oh, I'm so grateful that I can be in this class, but I have to wear this mask. I can't breathe because of the mask like, um, I mean, I don't really know what else to say. Like it's just pretty unbelievable that we like we're going to yoga classes in the middle of a pandemic and wearing face masks, right? Like, you know, just like, it was weird. It was weird times. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  15:08  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I mean, I am biased, but I think Kula has one of the best online libraries of classes in the biz. They have all sorts of different length classes, all from sorts of different style classes. It's, I mean, like, it's just such a great, great catalog. of yoga classes. Um, there's another one that I really like called the movement method. I hope I'm, I hope I'm saying definitely is like movement method, movement method co Yes. Two really wonderful teachers who are kind of like in the Kula-sphere that do a lot of like, yoga with like, functional movement kind of type of classes that I really, really liked. Um, I think there's some really great things available online. And like, for the movement method thing, like, in particular, like, they, like one of the people lives in Canada. So like, I'm taking a class that was filmed by the teacher in Canada, we've never met, but like, it's such a cool like connection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  16:16  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;More likely than not, people are not wearing masks. Every once in a while, I'll have like a one off student that will have a mask on and I completely see and respect their decision. I'm like, kind of to your point like I am. So I'm a little surprised, like more people aren't, especially now like, we have this crazy, like air quality stuff again. I mean, it's just like, can you catch a break? But no, I would say for the most part, people are not wearing masks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  16:50  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Um, I'm teaching for regular classes right now, I often saw that a couple studios in Brooklyn, I have a full time nine to five job for a non-profit I think I mentioned earlier. And I feel, I mean, like, broadly speaking, I feel like I wish I could teach more. But I'm just not in a position right now that I can step away from my full time job, which is my goal. But yeah, I'm having a blast. I love teaching, I feel so lucky to be able to like be the agent for which someone can have an amazing experience because like, I've had so many amazing experiences. Taking class with teachers that I love and like to be able to, like have that privilege of providing that to someone is so cool and like special. So Prospect Park, I have not actually taught the class yet. But Brooklyn Flow, formerly Bend and bloom. There are a few teachers involved in that studio that are also involved with Kula. And they do this summer series, I think, like, pretty pretty much every summer that they'll have Brooklyn Flow teachers interspersed with other teachers. Actually remember something else that I'll add when I finished this, um, but like, one week, Brooklyn Flow another week, another teacher. And so they reached out to Nikki, who is the studio director at Kula, she's amazing. And she reached out to me and was like, would you want to do this? And I was like, absolutely. I think that's so cool. So I'm super pumped. It's on August on August 17. I believe at 7pm. And I would love for you to come. That would be the biggest class that I've ever taught. And I feel extremely honored to have been asked, I really do look up to a lot of these teachers. What's really cool to be like, kind of included in that group. I think it's very, very cool. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  19:08  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And then the other thing I was going to add that I should have mentioned is that last summer so summer 22. I did my 300 hour at the Shala which is a lovely, lovely studio in Fort Greene. And they do a park series also in Fort Greene Park. And they are out there every Saturday. It is so much fun. And so I taught a bunch of those classes last summer, or not, maybe not a bunch, but a decent amount. It was super, super fun. It's a lot of the same people that show up so it's really cool. And like I think I had done one in the fall of 20 Yes, because the training started in the fall of 2021. So I taught one of the park classes in the fall and then taught another one in May and it was like all the same people so it was really cool like seeing all of these people after like the winter and spring and we're all out like doing yoga again in Fort Greene park like amazing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  20:00  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yeah, I think I always have hope you know, you have to that's like, that's the thing that you have to believe that like, there is going to be a better thing beyond the great thing that we have right now. Um, I think it's, I think it's formed over time through trust. And I'm, what is the word I'm looking for? Commitment and like mutual investment by both parties. Um, and I think when you find a place you love, like you love that place, and you want to keep going. And I think that yes, these communities definitely took a hit during COVID. Like, how could they not have, but it was almost like, and in no way am I saying like, we needed the pandemic to happen, but like, we become so like, Americans are so individualistic, like, me, me, me, me, me. And it's almost like we needed this kind of, like, Come to Jesus like level like moment to be like, like, let's be grateful for our communities and like, show up for each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtney  21:17  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Because like, we don't know, like, what the future holds and we should, like, make the most out of every opportunity that we have to like, live to the fullest. It is so cheesy, but like it is, you know, but words of advice. I would say like keep going, you know, there is no way to do this practice wrong. I think that's why it's so amazing and why despite all of this like hardship, the yoga community has continued to like be here because like it's so special and you can use it when you need it to get through tough shit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>

              <text>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Origin story of yoga.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/K6T-pZwmaM3gaOHpGttNMFU8qIQ?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;0:00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;She is originally from Long Island and has lived in the city for the last several years. She works for a mental health nonprofit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;She has three dogs, including a 13 year old pitbull.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How she got involved in yoga.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/K6T-pZwmaM3gaOHpGttNMFU8qIQ?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=137s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;2:17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;In 2014, she started going to a yoga studio called Yogananda, which does not exist anymore, but it was right down the street from her parents house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;In 2017 and 2018, she found Kula and fell in love with the studio with all of the teachers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wrapping up teacher training on zoom.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/K6T-pZwmaM3gaOHpGttNMFU8qIQ?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=291s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;4:51&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We wrapped up the teacher training on zoom and here we are today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;She shares what it was like to be in teacher training with other individuals in person and online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teaching yoga in a studio.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/K6T-pZwmaM3gaOHpGttNMFU8qIQ?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=427s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;7:07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Being a brand new baby yoga teacher and dealing with the vicarious trauma of COVID-19 was not something that felt good for her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;In the year of 2020, she did not teach much at all, but took classes outdoors when people were offering socially distanced classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teaching at a few different studios.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/K6T-pZwmaM3gaOHpGttNMFU8qIQ?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=598s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;9:58&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;When things started to open up a little bit more in 2021, she started teaching at a few different studios in Brooklyn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;She had a lot of impostor syndrome when she first started teaching, but she has worked on it in her teaching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yoga in person vs. online classes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/K6T-pZwmaM3gaOHpGttNMFU8qIQ?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=787s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;13:07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga classes during the pandemic were both live-streamed and in-person, and a lot of the classes that she was teaching at that time were both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga in the middle of a pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Movement Method Yoga.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/K6T-pZwmaM3gaOHpGttNMFU8qIQ?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=909s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;15:08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Cooler has one of the best online libraries of classes in the biz. There are also great classes available online, such as the movement method.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teaching at Prospect Park.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/K6T-pZwmaM3gaOHpGttNMFU8qIQ?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1041s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;17:20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;She feels lucky to be able to be the agent for which someone can have an amazing experience taking a class with teachers she loves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Last summer, she did her 300 hour at the Shala&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yoga in Fort Greene Park.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/K6T-pZwmaM3gaOHpGttNMFU8qIQ?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1176s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;19:35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga in Fort Greene Park is a lot of the same people that show up, and it was really cool to see all of the people after the winter and spring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga is special and you can use it when you need it to get through tough shit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

              <text>My friend Dasha asked me to go-teach the first yoga class at this immersive Van Gogh exhibit in Chelsea. It was the first public indoor class I taught since March 2020 when the yoga studios in NYC closed temporarily at first and then permanently as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. We were required to wear masks, students socially-distanced and we had to use hand sanitizer before and after practice. This was an incredible experience for me. Not only was I able to teach in-person again (which I hadn’t done in a public space for more than a year at the time), but I also got to lead class in such a dynamic and unique space: bursts of saffron and cerulean splattered and swerved on the walls, the moody lighting gave a psychedelic vibe and the I could feel how excited the students were to just be in a cool place together safely (as safely as they could be) again. It was fantastic; I had missed teaching public classes. At the time, I had a robust virtual yoga following and many private yoga clients but there’s something special about teaching public classes - they feel dynamic and new and engaging in a wholly new way, and I was lucky enough to teach a public class in such a cool space. -Janel Feliz Martir.</text>

              <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  0:00  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;My name is Nick. I am the owner and operator of Yoga Agora in Astoria, Queens, and St. Mark's Yoga on St. Mark's place in the East Village. I opened Yoga Agora in 2010, and St. Mark's yoga is still relatively new. We opened that one in July 2021, after the COVID shutdowns had been lifted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  0:29  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And I have a personal love for the practice of yoga, I think it's, for me the perfect recipe of keeping physical, mental and social health in the most pristine condition. It can be physically moving the body, stretching muscles and strengthening muscles and getting the joints loosened up and getting the blood flow churning, I think are among the most available low hanging fruits we have for better body functioning, physical functioning in the world. And then, you know, going through those physical exercises with a sense of mindfulness awareness, feeling your legs step forward into a lunge and feeling your lower spine as you're twisting helps you know that that mind to body connection, I think it's a very powerful way of reducing stress, and increasing euphoria, mentally. So that is an important ingredient. And then, and then the social health aspect. I think there is a lot of talk of physical health and mental health, but maybe we forget that social health is as important of a pillar in that equation. And, you know, coming together in a community with other humans who are also sharing in those exercises and sharing, in that pinpointed focus moving in unison with other humans. And then, you know, having a little bit of small talk, and hello, how you doing little negotiation, when you go to a cubby shelf, and you try to put your stuff in at the same time you say, oops, sorry about that. Oh, no, you know, those little micro-interactions, I think, are hugely important for our just overall well being and our overall happiness in the world. And so, yeah, yoga felt like the perfect recipe of physical, mental and social health benefits. And so I fell in love with it. And then that love for the practice inspired me and motivated me to open a studio space where I could, you know, really put my energy full throttle into expanding its access. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  2:58 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yeah, Astoria was a, Astoria is a really, really great neighborhood. In 2010, it felt like Astoria was the kind of neighborhood where new city residents, especially if they were young, are fresh out of college, and especially if they were a freelancer or an artist, or, you know, if they were young and living on a budget. Astoria was a perfect neighborhood. And especially for artists and creatives and maybe even more, especially for those in the theater community because it's a very easy commute into the theater districtm Midtown Manhattan. It's geographic, the proximity of Astoria to Manhattan is very convenient. And it was quite affordable. And there are several, you know, two bedroom, three bedroom apartments that a couple, you know, college grads could all share. So, yeah, there were a lot of young people and a story of we're living on a budget and at the time in 2010, you know, New York City. I mean, I guess New York City is always kind of an expensive place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  4:18 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;But a lot of yoga studios, were, you know, yoga was getting was hugely was so popular throughout the 2000s. Even, you know, by the mid-90's, Madonna and Sting, you know, celebrities were talking about yoga and yoga became very, I guess, fashionable. And so some yoga communities, you know, for their own understandable reasons, used that trendiness to make it more financially successful or whatever the word might be for it, but it was expensive. And you know, a lot of young people, especially, maybe, you know, theater type dancers, and so on yoga can be very helpful for their creative pursuits. So they were interested in practicing yoga, but maybe couldn't afford other places. So, Astoria, which was a neighborhood where a lot of those types were living, seemed like a perfect spot to open a yoga studio, that was especially affordable. And since the rent was affordable, and since I and other of my colleagues were working together, were as passionate about the pursuit as we were, we were able to create a yoga space that could operate on $5 classes. It could operate soundly, the rent could get paid, the teachers could get well paid, ConEd could get paid, everything could work out financially. The space was large enough that as long as it filled up, we could operate on $5 classes. So, so that's what we did. And in 2010, the neighborhood was, it was, it was just perfect, you know, you just open it up. And people came pretty quickly, you know, it took about two years to, you know, like any business, any small business, you're going to need up, there's a lot of upfront costs. I had saved a decent amount of money doing like barbacking, and bike messaging, you know, I spent years doing that kind of stuff in the early 2000s. So I'd save some money, use that money to open the yoga space. And within two years, the money that was spent on it, I was able to recoup. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  4:37  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And in that time, Astoria has grown quite a bit. And a lot of, a lot of investments have been made, maybe more so in Long Island City, which is just south of Astoria  but still in Astoria itself. Some old you know, business institutions have closed down and new condos have been built in their place. New people have moved in. Some people call that gentrification. Okay, you know, there's a lot of different words for it. And maybe some of those words have a negative connotation or a positive connotation, depending on who you ask. But certainly Astoria is very special in that there are a lot of old time local residents. And so there are, I think, in any given class, you can find a good handful of students there who will talk about I remember coming here in 2010, and 2011. And they're still coming today. Because Astoria feels like the kind of place. It's hard to say why exactly my theory is, because Astoria is kind of, it's not like isolated, but it's the kind of place where like, for instance, the yellow line, it ends at Ditmars. And it's not necessarily the kind of place you're passing through on your way somewhere else. Maybe if you're going to the US Open and Flushing sure, then maybe you just pass through Astoria. Otherwise, if you're coming across the 59th Street Bridge, in some way, you're coming specifically to land in Astoria, and because of that, it feels like like an insular neighborhood. Not so transient people who come are meaning to come. And as a result of, I think the the feeling is very grounded and rooted. So, though new people have moved in, certainly, there's still a core group of the Western Queens you know, community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  9:10  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yeah, I guess the process of keeping the community together during those shutdown months really is a testament of the Astoria community itself and the Yoga Agora instructors themselves, Because a lot of sacrifice was made with our time and our resources and our finances to keep it together. And I'm very lucky to have that community around me taking - it takes a village - we hear that all the time. But wow, I mean, what a what an amazing lesson COVID was to really understanding that concept, it takes a village. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  9:55  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So during the shutdown months, when we were doing we did Zoom call classes at first. Which yeah, the, the original iteration was, hey, go home for two weeks. Okay, no problem. So everyone for next two weeks, we're gonna do Zoom. And yeah, we'll see in two weeks, and then we know what happened after that. But yeah, Zoom classes to start, and people got on. And, you know, there was a lot of discipline and commitment to keeping up the practice, even in the living room on Zoom. But certainly by the time you start getting into the warmer months, and even by late April and early May, it's spring time, you could see the Zoom classes, the Zoom room was thinning out. People are going outside, and by then it was kind of, we understood that outdoor transmission was not a real risk. So people are taking advantage of outdoor activities. You know, there was the, you know, it was a summer of George Floyd and activism became, you know, even those who never participated in marches or anything before said, you know, this would be a good time in history to get involved a little bit more with community activism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  11:13  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So outdoor, outdoor activity was proving to be safe, and maybe even much needed, because it allowed you to see others. So, as the Zoom Room is thinning out, and as people are enjoying the outdoors, we had an opportunity to take advantage of a new house that you know, the open streets are, yeah, so Open Streets is pretty popular now. But in the summer of 2020, it was still kind of like an obscure concept. And there's an amazing community activist here in a story named Evie on cyclists. And Evie actually lives just down the street from Yoga Agora, and I see her all the time. And she's awesome. You know, she's, she's a local mom, school board, community board. And she's just like all about town, just like hustling and doing awesome stuff, and is always in a good mood. She's awesome. And she applied for this obscure Open Streets permit on 31st Avenue. And she made the mention to me say, "Hey, listen, I'm thinking about you know, or I'm working on getting 31st Avenue made it into an Open Street," "What's an open street?" "Oh, just means you can't have traffic and you can use this pedestrian thorough way. So we can do activities there. You want to do your yoga classes?" And my answer, "Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds great." Okay, but I didn't really know much about it. And she helped quarterback, outdoor yoga classes. And all we had to do is announce it to our people through Instagram or email list. And then on July 1, we announced that we're gonna have an outdoor yoga class on 31st Avenue. 31st Avenue, open street. Come on by, it's donation based, you know, it's very public, anyone can come. And and then that, you know, planted the seed for our outdoor classes. And yeah, that's, that's what the shutdown once kind of felt like. Yeah, the - so yes, now we have like a full on regular schedule of outdoor classes, and there definitely has been an evolution in it. So while we started on the 31st Avenue, Open Street, what back when, again, no one really knew what an Open Street is. Open streets have become very, very popular. And that's a little bit. I don't know, it's not like harder to get a spot. But there's more people with stands and shops, it's not really so conducive for outdoor yoga these days. So as Open Streets became more popular, and also as the first winter set in. So I'm kind of all over the place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  14:03 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;But yeah, that the summer of 2020 we had open streets all the way through into November, and then the winter setting and the open street permit had expired. And so there was no more 31st Avenue open street. So what we did was we pivoted the yoga classes to another to another park nearby called Athens Square, which has like a flat surface courtyard. And we started and also has like this big gorgeous holiday tree. So it was like just so scenic and perfect and very like we even though it was like mid December, it felt warm. It's just like spiritually just felt warm. And we did outdoor classes there in Athens Square. And all through the winter. I mean, it was wild, you know, I mean, it was like, we had 6pm classes. It's already pitch black Dark. There was like, you know a couple there was like two, you know, elderly ladies who came every class. Other random people would like fall in one spot. So there's three people, four people, whatever. We're doing the classes outdoors, which is also kind of surprising. You know, it's like maybe the testament to yoga to Ujayi breathing through your nose, you do warm up you.... It's pretty amazing. And so we did the classes there throughout the winter. As that winter subsided, we got back into now the Spring of 2021 Open Streets reopened, but there were a lot more applications for Stan's shops and whatever. So we stayed in Athens Square. And we continue having classes there Monday through Friday at 9am is a nice morning, the birds are chirping, and it's right under like a canopy of very lush trees. It's beautiful, the temperatures perfect at that time. And, and then we also added classes in Astoria Park, which is a little bit further north. On the pool deck, there's like another open area deck overlooking the Astoria Park pool, which I think, don't quote me, but I do believe the Astoria Park pool is the largest in ground pool in New York City, I think, I think it has that designation being the largest. It's awesome. It's an awesome pool overlooks the pool, which then overlooks the river, which then overlooks to the skyline of Manhattan, which is one of the most gorgeous sites in the world. And yeah, it's very, very cool. And so yeah, so and we've continued, yeah, yeah, we've continued we, during the winter months, once. Since we have indoor space available now, we didn't do winter classes outdoors. But we are still doing spring, summer and autumn classes outdoors. And I think we will continue for the rest of the life of our studio. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  17:06  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;You do need that kind of perfect combination of first open space because you know, at The Astoria Park classes, we get over 40 mats thrown down, you know, and because that, that when we do on weekends, Saturday, Sunday at noon, perfect time, it's the weekend, so that one gets very popular. The Athens Park, it's a Monday through Friday class 9am during work hours, so it's not as crowded as that. But yeah, that Astoria park one is full. So we definitely need a large space in case a lot of people come out. Ideally flat, the flatness isn't a deal breaker, it could be somewhat hilly, it could be but best case scenario is flat. And then also an area where you know, you people wouldn't otherwise want to like sit down and picnic and camp, you know, like, basically, at Athens Park and the Astoria Park pool deck, we're not going to have one of those situations where we walk on up and there's just like a bunch of people with their blankets out having a picnic and we're like, oh, shoot, it took our yoga space. What do we do? Oh, do you guys mind moving like we don't want to do that to anyone. So the courtyard in Athens Park is not like a sit down and picnic place. It's a you know, place people just walk through. And so we can easily just sit down or yoga mats and do our thing. The Astoria Park pool deck, people walked by, but nobody's just going to sit down and spend the afternoon on the pool deck there, you know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  18:46 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So you have to find that, yeah, that place, it's large, it's flat. And it's not going to be a place where you know, people are going to want to have a picnic otherwise. So there are a lot of community gardens in the East Village. I walked by them a lot when I'm like handing out flyers and whatever. But some community gardens have open space, but it's very like rocky and hilly. Some community gardens are nice and flat, but they're very popular picnic destinations. And so it would be hard to clear it out for a yoga class. Or maybe they're small and flat. Or maybe they're like flat and people aren't having picnics, but they're very small. And there isn't much room you can maybe get like five minutes at most type of thing. So haven't found, like the right perfect spot. You know, Washington Square Park is pretty popular. There's a lot of people there. It's hard to clear out space for a yoga class. Tompkins Square, also very popular. So I'm definitely looking, if you have any ideas you know, let me know I mean, you're busy enough with school and everything but um, yeah, yeah, definitely. We we're on, we're on the lookout for a good outdoor spot for sure. And these village area. Yeah, it's true. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  20:07 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yeah, we've, we decided not to do the hybrid thing. You know, maybe to some extent, you always kind of wander off, you have to deal with like tech issues during class, which may happen just when you start trying to play music that happens, wait, why isn't my Spotify working? What's going on, we're trying to get the music going again. So there's always bound to be maybe some tech issues. We did not do the hybrid. I, I, okay, I can recognize how helpful tech can be for yoga instructors who want to keep in touch with their communities, you have your student who has to move halfway around the world for a job, and they just really love connecting with that particular instructor. And now we have this available this, the availability to have an instructor and a Student Connect halfway around the globe, through yoga, and that's wonderful. And actually, I know a lot of people who talk about getting their start in their yoga journey through YouTube videos, you know, and awesome, hell yeah, whatever, whatever gets you on the mat, it's wonderful. So that's very true. And that's why I do think that the, the use of technology with the yoga is very individual case by case, you know, evaluation. It is, I guess, you know, at the risk of, you know, sounding like an old Grump. And, at the risk of sounding that way, and hope it doesn't come across that way, is, you know, I think it's worth also remembering that the in person experience is hugely valuable. And it there's an energetic exchange that cannot be harnessed when there's a technological filter. So, you know, coming to a yoga class in person has, has a very beautiful vibration to it. And, you know, it, there's a place for that, and I guess, I've chosen to dedicate my energy and my pursuit of yoga as a practice, and I guess, as a career, if you want to call it that, solely to the in person experience. And, and then, and then I think, I think that's good for those who do have, you know, access to the technological experience. So those who want to use the technology and the remote classes to connect with their community. Beautiful, they have that and I, my energy doesn't interfere with theirs and, and they do their thing. And, and I think it then creates the mosaic of, of spreading the ancient teachings more widely. And, and so I think, yeah, the bringing the technology into the yoga practice, it's, it's finding its groove, it's harmonizing those, there are those who are figuring out how to use it very mindfully and responsibly and to benefit their community. And then there's those who are, you know, keeping it in more old school, you know, through the in person classes and I'm, I find myself falling more into that latter camp. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  24:10 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yeah. I love talking about the other instructors and lineages that inspire me. So yeah, thanks for getting a chance to indulge in that. But yeah, I found I resonated very well with Jivamukti Yoga, you know, the teaching I just, you know, I really enjoyed the classical teachings and the Jivamukti method inspired me to enjoy chanting I never really the few times. I tried chanting in Sanskrit and trying to form my mouth around these harmonies. i It was hard or whatever, I didn't connect with it. Jivamukti was the first time that I started to like feel a kind of groove, a flow with chanting In and I really liked that. And also Jivamukti, they had like a really nice setup with a vegan cafe that's like right there part of the studio. They had a class every hour on the hour. It's just it's like nice, perfectly manicured community setup. And there were two teachers there. One was Rima Rabbath, who had this like, unbelievable ability. First to just one I mean, like, you know, mechanically speaking, she just has a wonderful memory and remembers everyone's name. Okay, wonderful, you know, it's a nice thing. And she's not the only one who remembers people's names. But that's no small feat. Like, that's hard. She always does. But more than that, she, she, she addressed people not just remembering their name, but there was like a, like a real honest, you know, like, there's very, like genuine interest in who she's talking to, and who that person's cousin is and the friend that they brought, and that thing they did last weekend, and she seemed to like, genuinely not in a way that she's like, Oh, I Okay, see this person? Okay, let me put on my good Rima face and remember the name of Baba, but like, there was just something very real and human. She just seemed to really care about how people are doing. And, and I just always felt good in her class like she had she had classes that were huge, but you just always felt seen you always felt like oh, Rima sees me. Wow, I'm the most popular one among the 60 people, and I'm sure everyone felt that way, you know, just really awesome. And so it felt like real community when I would take Rima's class. And then there was a another teacher there, Jules, who just he was like this, like genius. In the ancient teachings. He he knew the texts, and he knew the verses. And he knew the stories and the the parables in the myths, and he knew the science and he knew the anatomy and he knew how to play a harmonium really well. And he just seemed like the kind of guy who just genuinely, like, yoga wasn't like a trendy thing that made him like look cool at a party. It was like, like a very serious life calling for him. That's how I felt. And I mean, it's I don't think it's just how I felt and He's genuinely the way it is. It's a life calling for Jules. And he shares that. And I think that when he teaches it's, it's he teaches through inspiration, you know, he just shares his love and he's got like the Michael Jordan effect. It's, it's not just that he puts up a bunch of points that he loves putting up the points more than any other player on the court. And that's what makes them great. And I think Jules has that, he just genuinely seems to love the, the teachings and so he just shares his love of the teachings and so, so I, I dedicated my practice to the Jivamukti lineage and when I found out that Jules and Rima were leading a teacher training together in Costa Rica, it's like, sign me up. This is a no brainer. I was like, I'm going. And so I signed up for the teacher training with Jules and Rima and then I, you know, became certified Jivamukti instructor. And, yeah, I'm very happy. I still take Rima's class. She has a studio on 27th Street, which is really beautiful. And I take her class, and Jules lives in Germany, but he travels and when he's in town, I'll take his class. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick  28:44 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Katonah, I find very fascinating. I mean, it's interesting, you know, the art types and the 90 degree angles. I get a lot of joy going into Katonah classes, and many of my friends who I respect so much for their intellect and their discipline are deep into Katonah study. And I've seen how it really does a world of good for those who get into it. And yeah, St. Mark's Yeah, there are several you know, Brian and Cassie and Greg, you know, they're deep into the Katonah study. And and that's and there are also all seasoned instructors from Jivamukti. Like Matt Lombardo, Luis Dávila, they're, they're on the St. Mark schedule. nd it's kind of cool at St. Marks. So we have this sort of like several lineages coming together in this, you know, dense urban, cultural melting pot that we call East Village, New York City. And we all kind of and yeah, it's so, it's so historic and it's so cool and the energy. I mean just think about like the names that have walked by there and you know, the people punk rock and Kerouacs. And, you know, you think about what, what what kind of like a creative lineage exists in that area and there's something about it, you just walk through those streets and there's a vibration, it's unique to any place on planet Earth really, when you consider who's walked there before you and what they've left to the history of humanity. Walking in that area, you're like, whoa. Like, like, you can feel it, you just feel like this is like you're in, you're in a vibration of creativity unique on Earth. And it's very cool. And I like to think that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction to yoga.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/d0eRtADjrVKAPQ3mwE2VNFlQyVk?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;0:00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Nick is the owner and operator of Yoga Agora in Astoria, Queens and St Mark's yoga in the East Village.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga is the perfect recipe for physical, mental and social health benefits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opening a yoga studio in Astoria.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/d0eRtADjrVKAPQ3mwE2VNFlQyVk?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=162s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;2:42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Astoria was a great neighborhood in 2010, especially for artists and creatives, and especially for those in the theater community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga was hugely popular throughout the 2000s in New York.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Some yoga communities used trendiness to make it more financially successful, but it was expensive. Astoria was the perfect place to open a yoga studio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;It took about two years to open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The story of Astoria.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/d0eRtADjrVKAPQ3mwE2VNFlQyVk?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=417s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;6:56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The story is special in that there are a lot of old time local residents. There are a good handful of students there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The community is grounded and rooted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;It takes a village.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/d0eRtADjrVKAPQ3mwE2VNFlQyVk?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=577s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;9:37&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;It takes a village. During the shutdown months, they did Zoom call classes during the winter. By spring time, people were going outside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Outdoor activity was proving to be safe and needed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;In the summer of 2020, Open Streets was still an obscure concept. Now it is popular and has evolved into a full schedule of outdoor classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;31st Avenue ws where Yoga Agora held classes during Open Streets in summer 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The transition from open streets to outdoor classes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/d0eRtADjrVKAPQ3mwE2VNFlQyVk?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=820s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;13:39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga classes moved from 31st avenue open street to another park nearby called Athens Square, which has a flat surface courtyard and a big holiday tree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Open Streets reopened in spring of 2021.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Classes are held Monday through Friday at 9am, under a canopy of lush trees in Athens Square and classes are also held in Astoria Park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finding a good outdoor yoga space.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/d0eRtADjrVKAPQ3mwE2VNFlQyVk?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1186s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;19:46&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Community gardens in the East Village are popular picnic destinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Tompkins Square is also very popular. They are on the lookout for a good outdoor spot for a yoga class.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They decided not to do the hybrid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The use of technology with yoga is individual case-by-case evaluation. The in-person experience is hugely valuable and cannot be harnessed when there is a technological filter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Technology is finding its groove in yoga.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Jivamukti Method.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/d0eRtADjrVKAPQ3mwE2VNFlQyVk?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1451s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;24:10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Jivamukti was the first time that he started to feel a kind of flow with chanting in sanskrit. Jivamukti had a nice setup with a vegan cafe and a class every hour on the hour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Rima has a wonderful memory and can remember everyone's name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yoga is a life calling.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/d0eRtADjrVKAPQ3mwE2VNFlQyVk?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1612s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;26:52&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga is a serious life calling, and he shares his love of the teachings through inspiration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;There are several seasoned instructors from Jivamukti who are on the St. Marks schedule, and it's kind of cool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;East Village, new york city is a melting pot of several lineages coming together in this dense urban cultural melting pot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Relationships are everything, and the world doesn't run on money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                    <text>Interview &amp; Contribution Form - NYC Yoga
Studios Archive
Website: nycyogastudiosarchive.art
The primary focus of this digital humanities project is to collect, protect and share the story of how
the NYC Yoga industry functioned pre-pandemic and the yoga community’s overall response to the
COVID-19 pandemic restrictions (Timeline Dec 2019-Dec 2022). The NYC Yoga Studios Archive
Omeka Classic digital art exhibition website showcases each studio on an interactive, geographical
map with indication of the open, online, livestream option or closed status, along with any publicly
available data and/or crowd sourced contributed content in the format of textual documentation,
images, audio or written interviews, teacher training memories and rePections. The NYC Yoga
Studios Archive site will be available to the public for a limited time and eventually permanently
stored in the digital library at the CUNY Graduate Center as part of a Masters Degree Capstone
project in the Digital Humanities. 
How this form works:
1. Use the simpliVed content submission form here if you just want to upload a photo or media
Vle and go!
2. You may use this form just to  complete a written interview and skip photo/media upload.

�What is the name/address of the studio of your affiliation?
YO BK - 20 Broadway, Brooklyn NY 11249 / 607 Manhattan Ave, Brooklyn NY 11222 / 2319B N Miami Ave,
Miami FL 33127

What type or class varieties of yoga did you teach/taught for this studio and/or in
general? Please list and be specific. NOTE where copyright may apply.
Our three locations offer Traditional Hot Yoga (Bikram), Power Vinyasa Yoga, Yin/Restorative Yoga and
Inferno Hot Pilates (HIIT). Our Greenpoint location also features Aerial Yoga.

What would you like to share about yourself as a yoga teacher or studio owner of NY
and having survived this time (Dec 2019-2022) in the industry? How did this any of the
closure/layoff impact your career/outlook/life in NYC as a whole? 
Lockdown and the pandemic were truly a time of putting one foot in front of the other. I recognized that
the isolation of lockdown meant many of our students would miss moving their bodies in community.
The first day we shut down in March of 2020, we offered online classes which continued for over 1 year.
In June of 2020, I began contacting hotels, restaurants and venues so that when outdoor dining
reopened in July, we were able to offer 30 outdoor classes per week. By keeping our community active
and engaged, we were able to successfully reopen both NY locations and expand to Miami in February
2022.

Location: If you are at freedom to share any facts or about the building and space that
your studio is/was located in, please feel free to share as much as your willing. Details that
concern the accessibility of the building are of highest interest.
All locations are outfitted with infrared heat, showers, gender neutral changing areas and HVAC updated
with bi-polar ionization to keep the air we breathe clean.

Are you or your studio participating in any interesting social justice or charitable
work that you are permitted to share and want to make mention to between 2019-2023?
Yes! We offer weekly community classes benefitting various causes, including Iranian Human Rights and
Sexual Assault Awareness. This month we are raising funds for LGBTQ+ youth in NYC and Black Women
in Wellness. All benefit classes are donation-based, open to all and available to join for as little as $5. We
are very proud to stand behind these causes and opportunities for students to practice at a lower rate
than our normal drop-in.

The Before, During and after of "Unprecedented Times"

A gentle reminder that no one was alone teaching yoga on zoom, or alone with their mask on in the
yoga room, we did it together. We want to hear YOUR story!

�In your experience, what was the NYC yoga studio culture/classroom like at your
studio or in general before the coronavirus pandemic in or around 2019? 
Examples of the difference in the types of events that used to take place in person versus
online, or how technology was or was not a part of your classroom.You may share as far back
in time as you wish to.
Our studios have always been places for community. Pre-pandemic, majority of our students were
members practicing with us 3-6 times per week and this remains true today. Our biggest shifts have been
the moderation of mat spots per class (we're still operating at 75% of our original capacity to make
students more comfortable) and the continuation of outdoor classes at the Box House Hotel.

What was your experience of the NYC yoga studio culture/virtual classroom like
throughout coronavirus lockdown for studios in NYC (March 2020 - June 2021)?  
I shared a bit of this before, but lockdown was a challenging time to own any type of small business in
NYC. We pay high commercial rents here which rely on cash flow. My landlords were incredibly flexible
because they believed in our mission and wanted us to stay. We strived to provide different ways for
students to practice within their comfort zones: in-studio, outdoors, online and on-demand.

In your experience, what was the NYC yoga studio culture/classroom like
after coronavirus? Please include how it felt to return to in-person yoga work, especially if
you had to teach in a mask.
It took a while for many of our students and staff to feel comfortable in-studio again, and the spaces
really feel back to normal. One big shift is the classes students seek out now: we've seen a big shift
towards meditation and slower classes like yin and restorative.

Community and Connection

Great things to share are how long you've been teaching overall, details about your tenure, what that
means to you and COVID-19's impact on your business/teaching career.

�What was the response in your yoga community to your studios overall endurance
throughout the pandemic?
For example, stories about community &amp; how it felt to try to maintain that
connection throughout the pandemic through the screen.
How did your pre-covid following stay/change/evolve with your studio throughout covidpresent?
Have any former students reconnected with you virtually from a different place that left the
area a long time ago, if yes how did that feel? (do not share any names of students without
their consent)
Outdoor classes from July 2020 onwards brought in a lot of new students and we are still seeing prepandemic students return through our doors. Greenpoint and Williamsburg are transient areas but we
were also incredibly fortunate in the past 3 years that people have continued to move into the area who
love practicing yoga and pilates.

Props &amp; Media: Do you know if your studio used to or still presently carry/sell yoga
props and media? The purpose of this question is to understand the types of books that are
inside of studios, and if props were still being used or removed during the Pandemic. If they
were removed, were they ever replaced?
Yes, we carry yoga mats, blocks, straps and a selection of yoga clothes.

 Did you teach outdoors or did you studio host outdoor classes during the summers
of 2020-2022? 
If yes, please share the location (NYC Park name, address/studio name of the rooftop, garden,
backyard, common space, public pool area, beach, playground, school yard, etc) and affiliated
studio and your first hand experience.
Yes: McCarren Park, Domino Park, Shaffer's Landing, Dobbin Street Collective, the William Vale, the
Williamsburg Hotel, the Box House Hotel and Boggart House.

�Were there any unique events that you/your studio performed online during 2020-2021
that are worth mentioning? Examples: Live stream music and yoga events and dynamic
workshops are of great interest.
We offered 3+ daily classes from March 2020-October 2020 and paired down after that with the shift to
outdoors and on-demand.

How did your pre-covid &amp; post-covid teaching schedule change? 
Example: How did your schedule fluctuate as a whole - Time of day, duration of class wise,
class type, location wise, hybrid based class wise?
Pre-covid, we offered 60 weekly classes in NYC locations. During lockdown, this changed to 3-4 daily
online and outdoor classes. Now we are above 100 classes per week.

The Now and Forever of Yoga is Digital 

 

As smartphone apps and digital coaches take over, what do you want to share with students?

Are you or is your studio still teaching live stream classes online as of present (Jan
2023)?  
If yes, when did you start? List the exact date or year if you know. If yes, where were your
remote classes located?
No and we don't miss them!

�Teaching &amp; Technology: The goal is to learn the impact of tech on yoga
teaching. Feel free to answer any of these questions as it may apply.
 Did you teach in any hybrid capacity and what was your experience?
What was it like teaching yoga in different or new ways? (livestream, hybrid, text, photos,
voice memos, emails, recording yourself, etc)? What was challenging or better about it?
 What were your existing technology tools like (at-home or in-studio) at the start of the
COVID-19 pandemic and what has your studio evolved into? Details like any technology or
apps you have invested in are welcome.
In our experience the hybrid model doesn't work -- it's nearly impossible for a teacher to focus on a
screen and on the bodies in front of them. Livestream was a nice option when it was the only option,
however I feel that students get so much more out of their practice when they are surrounded by other
students and are in a space dedicated to movement.

 

What was it like teaching with or without music online? 

We utilized music via Spotify, and fortunately Zoom's technology has evolved to stream seamlessly.

 

Do you still/have you chanted or use a harmonium in online classes? 

Yes I play the harmonium
Yes I chant
Yes I do both
I don't to any of these

�Were any other languages outside of English used to teach yoga classes online or in
person at your studio? Including ASL. If yes, which language(s). 
English only. We do have in-person Spanish classes now in NY and Miami.

&lt;td&gt;Yes I chant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;English only. We do have in-person Spanish classes now in NY and Miami.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Zoom, Instagram Live, Uscreen&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Uscreen&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Spotify&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interview Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date of Interview: June 17th, 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  0:00  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;My name is Arjuna, I'm a Sivananda yoga teacher. I primarily teach in New York City Center and 24th and 8th. I used to teach [at the] an ashram Upstate, Woodbourne, I was on staff in Ashram for few years like we can staff and other stuff. I did Karma Yoga there. I do karma yoga, Sivananda  Bahamas, I'm a Sivananda certified TTC graduate from Sivananda Bahamas. I also did my ATTC advanced, teachers' training. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  0:29  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And the brief background. I'm from India, I grew up in yoga, that was a yogi and the Gita grandfather, ayurveda, I grew up in Sanskrit. So I'm pretty intimately familiar with Sanskrit, Hindi, yoga in general, as it grew up with that. My journey like you know, it's what I call like the spiritual awakening, right? It is, something that happens as a consequence or what is called karana vairāgya. Karana is the reason for somebody getting on the path, which can be many forms, it's not necessarily doing something physical or some divine thing to do something outside of yours, thine own self, right? So stepping outside of that, that limited self being and for that somehow there's a lot of pain and suffering back then. And this Dharma Mittra teacher, actually there's this guy called Dharma Mirtra, I'm not sure if you're familiar with Dharma Mittra studios. And she was a Dharma Mittra and a Bikram teacher, she was a French teacher and seventy years old. And I was really suffering because even I was. And then she really took me under her wing, she was teaching me back into yoga. I know, I know, Sanskrit, you know. And then slowly I got into Sivananda and I was doing karma yoga. And and, and I didn't realize that I had all this knowledge from India and I was totally lost in America. And then it's nice when, when the student awakens, the teacher shows up, right, so that's the way it goes. So and then one blessing of another's showed up. And this was many years of practice and, and obstacles, like I had my shoulder dislocated I yhink a week before I was supposed to do my first teacher training at Sivananda. I was injured in some martial arts and all that, that the shoulder popped back up again. And I couldn't go to the teachers training, I was so disappointed. So there are obstacles. And then somehow, you know, the journey continued. And I got another opportunity to do my TTC and ATTC. So this is like I would say 2014, 2015. So 2012, 13 range. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  2:43  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yeah, I was teaching in the center for the regular class 3:30pm on Saturdays for many years. It was like a big class, people like I, this, I particularly felt for this one woman. And a lot of regular I love to teach a 3:30pm class. So we build this together, feeding off of the energies and building up the momentum. It's a boat. Student is no above or below. When somebody is teaching. It's just a it's a it's, it's, it's, it says in the prayers. So but yeah, so yes, I was stitching all the way before the COVID hit. Yeah, so thanks for asking. Again, it's a it was pretty hard and, and, and emotional for a lot of people and a lot of suffering with families and things and looking around and the shutdown and the uncertainity and the anxiety and the fear, which is exactly what yoga is supposed to alleviate a little bit of peace of through that pranayama and the breathing and the mind control. To be fairly honest, like I did for my personal side of point of view, it did not affect me much in terms of initially did not affect me. In in a sense, I don't have case, I like in my own particular personal situation. I like you know, I also had a corporate job working there. I didn't, I was working for Bank of America actually. It's uh, it's so - I don't have financial issues. I don't have personal issues like you know, so I have pretty much relaxed from my own perspective. But then again, the whole aspect of giving off contact with the with the things has slowly started taking its toll. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  4:32  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Right like and your points I'm not a big fan of online or digital classes myself. That's that's definitely personnel. Part icular there was opportunities to teach virtual courses online. Zoom, I did. but yeah, we're gonna get deeper into the Zoom and my experiences with that. But yeah, so to start off, it was a tough period.  I did not teach even a single online course. So end of story there. So that's been my experience, there were opportunities, in the there were other people teaching in the organization. Yes, it was always affiliated with the Sivananda center. But just to couple of other things, there were other courses online that I was more interested in like Gita right to the study of the Gita, the Upanishads, and codev. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  5:26  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I got really benefited during the COVID time to withdraw within. And regarding the practice myself, I, I do a lot of my own practices, but then it's taken its toll. During the COVID, as it got deeper, I got really lost without the people who contact and the touch and even the self motivation did not work to be honest too. Because as a teacher, I do my own practices of for many years and and I did resign from Bank of America, to be honest, just on a personal note, and my friend, she was shocked. Like, I mean, who would let go was a VP of, of a investment bank. And I did that I, I resigned from the job because like any of us, that's on the personal side.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  6:18  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;But then I went to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, South Jersey, where there were some studios that opened up a little bit earlier before New York opened up. And I just did not return to my condo for six months, I had to do what I had to do to try to find the context myself, try to. But yeah, I mean, in trying to teach in a backyard of a friend with a couple of other guys, things of that nature. But ya know, online, but the experiences have been tremendous. I had to do what I do to be following up some kind of people content helping or whatever that that's, that's the most important thing that got lost with the human contact and the human touch. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  7:04  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yeah, so it was a challenge in terms of for weeks and weeks, I had one one person show up, I had two person show up. And towards the end up, this is after he initially started going and we were thinking of like, you know, Neethi runs the center, we were giving some open, open classes open, which means you do have an introduction to people who would want to come in for a, let's say, an hour of meditation that we teach course, plus a free yoga class and then having some brunch or breakfast, vegetarian lifestyle meals, which is been if you look at the contrast before the COVID and after this was pretty regular business as usual, we have open like, you know, that's the whole point, the organization Sivananda, is to disburse the teachings of Master Sivananda. And as part of that, the mission or the goal is to invite or do an open, open house with with introduction to yoga and people who were just, you know, trying to help them understand as a traditional organization and methodology, it's just not jumping in with some with with just the body movements, it is a lot more deeper for for us in terms of when you say the breath, the intimate connection between the breath in the mind control and there is also just to mention this during the COVID There are three kinds of destroying some Sanskrit it's called three kinds of suffering that people encounter one is a Japanese car, a Japanese car means it's coming from within myself, whether this life or the past life, it is a pain from past some scars and vasanas that are coming from from me and are the Baltica is is a is a pain and suffering inflicted from somebody else which might be an animal which is another human being anything and are the Dibakar which is a third which which I would find particularly interesting is caused by natural events like the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Pandemic apparently falls in that are the direct or the third aspect of that so called so I recognize it right away as a in terms of things that are in your control and things that are not and absolutely it's a it's a period of global suffering and being crazy like you know, at least like you know. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  7:21  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We do World World Peace chanting and this is a time once again to contrast before industry one on the divine life society in India Rishikesh where master was there the they have a continuous chanting ever since 1947, I believe for world peace going on. And it is a tremendous amount of, like, the thought. So we did pray a lot in that and try to participate from different, like, you know, step in and so yeah, so back to realizing that, you know, this is a so and then the mind which goes in and out of the Gunas, which is the sattva, rajas, and tamas, which is the state of the mind. And I'm not the mind I'm not the body, which is a very fundamental thing Master does attach and detach, which is you attach to who I truly am and all kinds of suffering comes from attachment to the the soul the spirit or what do you call the Atman. And then you detach from the unreal, which is the why right, which is the baker is the discrimination between the nature and, and, and the consciousness. So you detach from the mind and from the mind degenerating all this, this whole, like, you know, all the suffering comes from but anyways, so master was very clear back then. So it is the whole, but But even she went on the Bahamas got shut down, which is a major source of goodness in this world, I believe at least, and the purity and the austerities those guys do there, they really shut down. And that was a I mean, I took it personally and but then back to your point, they built up this online stuff, they were doing online courses, whatever they can, whatever you can pray for the world, whatever you can help out. There were some friends of mine who were nurses. And the frontline people who really had to take the brunt of the COVID is one thing for a guy like me can even with saying that, you know not able to have this human contact. And guess what there are frontline people who are healthcare practitioners who were nurses with emergency and all this. And, and the courage they had to go through it was I did my best to please the people I know trying to, you know, get some pranayama going or trying to give them the moral support or just to talk to somebody either through voice or digital media. But yeah, it was tough time trying times and hope I answered. Much. Yeah, so it's nice to remind us, it's absolutely back to normal as far as I am concerned, personally, but not completely normal. Apperently for example, you're asking about the satsang. Last week, I think there's only Satsang on Wednesdays, but there's no Satsang on Sundays, there are certain things like that which are not fully and there is apparently lack of staff because it takes a lot to maintain the New York Center with like the International Yoga Day, the United Nations whatever that is actually India, I believe India's mission, like the official representation of India in the United Nations, they push for the International Day and they apparently reached the New York City Center and it was turned down because we don't have staff you know, it is sad to see that. So there is some repercussions that is going on. But having said that, just to take a step back Mastiff that was something interesting. And there were issues were in in the classroom there was this this she's she's still here she comes in every week. She's a hypersensitive Japanese lady. She's very very hypersensitive to to the air. Even though she wears a mask the teacher wears a mask I was wearing a mask, it was always she raises the windows up during the Cold which is during the November and and during the season where it affected other students. So it was like a normal kind of a challenge. How do you how do you slowly trying to convince and we finally came to some agreement nowadays at least after the masks are gone to that she could do it before the class starts. So it's how I'm giving her the freedom to experience the spaciousness and and and during the cold and so on. But then again I just slowly explained to her like you know it's you're affecting somebody else who's she's look at her she's almost he doesn't have a sweater or a jacket or jacket. He's downstairs so there was challenges in that nature. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  14:37  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And donning the mask itself is a big thing because the whole point is the the primer coming in through the nostrils and a couple of bodies and in some some Pranayamas we don't even teach and it's highly rusticus and such which needs a little bit more. But at least even those two If there was some kind of pranayama obviously, initially when things start settled in, and of course following New York City mandate of when the mass, but the moment it came back the first thing that comes back in is a pranayama because that's how we distinguish ourselves in Sivananda as compared to every other things. And Swami Vishnu who started the organization in the west and.., he and the pranayama goes at the end of the class normally, and he pushed it to the start of the class just to because that's the most important thing is the mind that drives the body. Because the body is the hardware, it's in the mind is the one so to have the proper especially to in terms of COVID pranayama is in in unbelievable, it's just stabilizes the mind the central nervous system, it has so many benefits, somebody needs to read the whole art of pranayama the prana, apana udhana, there's so many different kinds of how and and...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  16:02  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So yeah, so the first thing that came back in was a friend of mine in my personal class occasion, I don't know about other Sivananda teachers in my class. If you if you just do the pranayama and if you just lay in savasana the rest of the postures you are equally in my view as you did your class   with a warrior just like somebody standing on one finger, or a headstand and stuff. So the point is the importance of pranayama which is, which is, drives the mind so yeah so the once the masterered it I was so happy, get the regular staff.. and people start showing up by still like four or five people. Sometimes we had to cancel, it's it's just one people it was just not in using the mind body online software we use for the neighborhood, I would know (which) how many people registered, so it was not worth my time to come from N-Jersey City. The weekends with all the path and --- it was just one person registered, we cancelled. And there was a problem once when four people showed up after a class was canceled and Neethi was like you guys did not register before so there was a challenge of like, what do you call that, you show up without registering? And it hurt me personally because it's just when somebody shows up, is I just take it because I teach for free and it's just one of the few, so it kind of I took it personally, and I kept it -I  kept showing up after that, every week. So it's like changes like that, how, how the importance of you know....and there were&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  17:43  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;There was this woman who showed up during the time and she she she was going through a tough time with with with and she really tapped me after the class and be honest about it the bodies to is out of out of what it was before and pre COVID and post COVID It's it's it's added a lot more calories for everybody it brought in that extra weight which is what we call the massive state that the mass is the inertia the dullness and and the state of Tomas Tomas is is very hard which is what the COVID did a lot of people in the world and you are the couch potato but not by choice this time or by our so if you and people had no options and he actually was really shut down and I was really shocked actually to be honest because my mom every time she visits from India she's like the city that never sleeps and that kept ringing in my in my head and like six o'clock the Starbucks was like oh my god it was Gary was gone and I was like literally jaw drop and but anyways yes so so just to that whole experience of ecstatic I'm like I was like cuz it's just the nature of it's it's what are called dualities in nature right the pleasure the pain, the happiness and happiness just swings and unfortunately we think that we could control it and you can because anything that goes down will have to come up everything that's up will have to it that's nature and realizing that it's a matter of time before something ends it is having that like as human beings we also have this innate in our nature to feed off from the other other other communities right like other people like it's just a it's a we're so social beings in in in trying to feel the compassion feel the pain of somebody else feel the happiness of somebody else. That's part of what I meant by human right. So in that sense. Yeah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  19:54  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So it is it is when when things started falling back into an normally just the classes started coming up, and you get this boom influx of 15 people like today or I see I got this bigger classes, which was a normal before the COVID. Because at 3pm, it was already full, I had to, like, you know, you had to do the double lay like you have to interleave the master the way people. But some classes were full even. Occasionally, even before today, like it's been there. And it just excites my ex, I just, I feel good because somebody is investing their time, and they're on a Saturday morning or something to come and give their time to in if I can help them, you know, be an instrument. And you know, there are some prayers I do personally that would. So yeah, to your point. And when somebody shows up, like, as you're talking about this woman who was going through injury, she the little pony how much if she said she felt peace and really touched me, you know, it's that's exactly what this whole thing about, even if I don't care about, I had lots of experience in the past where you know, there was this woman who really was not doing well. And so my goal is very simple. Even if we have one person who felt like she had some piece, I don't really care about the rest of the guys, I'm just being brutally honest. It's my mission. And goal is as simple as that is, there was this other guy was a football player, he was like a, he got injured, like he's a quarterback in like, he's like a, and he really looks like I've touched in there are people who come up, and that is the in when the when the whole thing lifts, when the New York state mandate lifts that you could take away the mass, you're basically free to back to normal, of course, like to buy the classes or the staff and such that is a combination of several elements, which is hopefully, you know, maybe the split in the digitalization, people move away, people are coming in. So it goes on See, the suffering never ends, right. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  22:00  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So human, it's the nature of the human mind and the Beast and, and the, the objects. Like, you know, the sensors are constantly going out, which is, especially in New York City. And I you notice the sensors are always constantly going out, it's what are called raga and Vasia. In Sanskrit, which is the attractions and the versions, the more just to add color to it, it the more I'm lost in the objects, I'm my subject is real, and there is no end to the suffering cycle, you cannot be cannot, when your mind is lost in objects, it's like one thing after another, the focus is just the census. So but Yahara, which is just filling the mind within its and that's, that's what in the center stands for, in my opinion, which is trying to portray to somebody to go a little bit within by closing eyes being present with the breath. Of course, I have a lot of guys who cannot close their eyes, can you believe that? And sometimesm I just it's like, you know, they just watch me when I teach the pranayama and it's, it's, I just feel for them because, you know, it might be trauma. But none of my business and, and, and there was a time when somebody was not able to do that. And this is pre COVID is nothing during the COVID when she was able to really feel at ease and and she closed her eyes and and I was through like I was jumping inside like that made my day right? It's just like, it took her probably good five classes in a regular to just achieve that state compared to others wherein you can close your eyes and feel safe, you know, and it is all about safety and, and some kind of trauma, some kind of a and yes, I'm excited. I'm thrilled. It's I was thinking of the same thing before we started this interview. And I think we all have that within us. It's just that tapping that aspect of us that energy that that shows up in different aspects in different forms. Some people find the nursing, some kind of a way of giving some people do it in different ways, I believe. So as to me personally, I just found something which is the Masters grace and masters blessings, which manifests into the divine cause and the mission because ultimately if you take the core of all this is selfishness, it comes down to plain, good old fashioned sense self centeredness. Rooted in this, like you know, the more we get, the more we want, and this is the stuff we were talking before. You know, it's it's an unending feeling. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  24:53  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;New York City is a perfect place for it. I realized this 10 years back I think it also comes with a lot of experience and a lot of pain of course. So the motivation is definitely coming from the lineage connection. Especially, say hand, hand to hand, passed in generation to generation of teachers all the way to Shankaracharya. Who was the incoming from India? I absolutely am aware that there are six major lineages and all the yoga you see in the wall, the billion dollar industry is already created. At some point, it's it's not really it falls into a lot of people guys copied from us. Sivananda is one of the very authentic I know the lineage. So I feel the lineage connection, I think that's a better answer. But to be really honest, you just practice it. And it comes from our own suffering and trying to feel that I did suffer. And the fact that the before and after trying to that's the spiritual awakening I was talking about, and and there should be little grace of God and then everything else is is trying to do the practices, which are called vyasa. And vyragya vyasa is the constant practice of even if you fall down, you get up right the resiliency, right? Like and the resiliency comes from people who are doing it. While the guys who fought whatever the battles they're fighting in their life, they're suffering, they're raising kids. In not necessarily COVID. Right, this is good old plain...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  26:18  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I think this is one of the most important reason why we are doing this for somebody in the future who are looking up to only people who come here and researching this or looking at this, or somebody's interested more than themselves. Which is forming, which is how we learn. That's how I learned and I'm pretty sure Allison, that's how you learned as well, with teachers coming in our way. With gurus sending the message and what is called satsang.  We are-  we interact with holy people who have that spiritual energy. And if you're in that space of their spiritual energy, the blessings keep coming. And that is how we plug in, and that's how we pick up. And that puts aside our limited self or the small life aside, and then you will see. So I would suggest the same thing, the same path did not change. He was always guru to Guru teachers in different forms and fashions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  27:13  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So any young school student of yoga or any anybody like, you know, New York City, and they're trying to, it's just realizing that like, you know, in the we can do this alone in we learn this and get trying to keep the traditional yoga, which is what everybody understands for as authentic as possible. So I don't alter it in a way that is suitable for deviations, things and it's exactly how I was taught and, but I need to understand make some effort to go to that source, even certain authentic sources you will might not find in New York City. In a it's basically the point is a little bit, people who come to Sivananda, or guys who realize that there's a little bit more to yoga than the physical body. And somebody who's interested in the yoga philosophy, somebody who does do our teachers training to learn more about the original. So people who are spiritual, like you know, getting to that aspect of there is more to the the body. And all Eastern religions are based in the mind including Buddhism, and it's all about the mind and the emotions and how the mind gets captured by the objects and it stays there for years and then we wake up and so it's all about freedom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arjuna  28:33  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And it's so I would suggest two things plain simple, learn from authentic sources, get to the spirituality of that person and get into that and number two, it's just you can do it in New York City and like few stay put like and this is from personal experience, and I used to say a personal challenge, right? If I'm, I used to feel bulletproof at some point, not now. I used to really feel bulletproof were in New York City was a challenge and I looked up on New York City as if I can stay centered, like I imagined a halo around me and and this is after my TTC especially like my advanced pranayama, I almost have like, unbelievable and I was taking the practice very deep. So it just like imagine a yellow halo and anything energies coming through me is to just roll off. I don't even need to have to face the Battle of processing it. And it's just stay centered and and rooted. Yeah, so it is possible in New York, I'm pretty sure it's just a it's just it's a combination of our own thirst for how much peace do we want, right? How much freedom do we really want? Right? Is that everything? Is that.. it's more and more and... you know?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/Me9WOUZhii2uQ18sHqokt1I2-Ys?tab=summary"&gt;Arjuna Sivananda Yoga Teacher, Chelsea NYC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction to Arjuna.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/Me9WOUZhii2uQ18sHqokt1I2-Ys?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;0:00&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arjuna is a yoga teacher who primarily teaches in new york city center and polycotton eight. She grew up in yoga and is intimately familiar with sanskrit yoga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was injured in some martial arts a week before he was supposed to do his first teacher training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The beginning of the end of her journey.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/Me9WOUZhii2uQ18sHqokt1I2-Ys?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=148s"&gt;2:27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoga is supposed to alleviate a little bit of peace through pranayama, breathing, breathing and mind control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on yoga and ttc and ATTC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teaching online courses.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/Me9WOUZhii2uQ18sHqokt1I2-Ys?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=283s"&gt;4:42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were opportunities to teach virtual courses online during the covid-19 pandemic, but james did not teach a single online course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing that got lost during the pandemic was the human touch and the touch and even the self-motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The challenges of opening a meditation center.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/Me9WOUZhii2uQ18sHqokt1I2-Ys?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=426s"&gt;7:06&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of only having one or two people show up for most of the time during the covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in business during and after the pandemic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission and goal is to invite people to an open open house with an introduction to yoga and a traditional organization and methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three kinds of suffering during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The state of the mind and body.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/Me9WOUZhii2uQ18sHqokt1I2-Ys?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=605s"&gt;10:04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sattva rajas and tamas are the state of the mind and the body. Master does attach and detach. All kinds of suffering comes from attachment to the soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courage and courage they had to go through it was to try to please the people they know, trying to get some pranayama going or to talk to somebody through voice or digital media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satsang is back to normal, but not completely normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenges of wearing the mask.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/Me9WOUZhii2uQ18sHqokt1I2-Ys?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=874s"&gt;14:33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that came back in was a friend of mine in his personal class, a friend who is a warrior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of pranayama is the mind that drives the body, because the body is the hardware, and the mind is the one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dealing with cancellations and cancellations.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/Me9WOUZhii2uQ18sHqokt1I2-Ys?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1020s"&gt;17:00&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nithi was shocked when four people showed up after a class was cancelled, and she took it personally. She kept showing up after that every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of nature is dualities in nature. The pleasure, pain, happiness and happiness just swings and unfortunately, there is no control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When classes started coming back to normal.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/Me9WOUZhii2uQ18sHqokt1I2-Ys?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1191s"&gt;19:50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things started falling back into normal, classes started coming up and the boom influx of 15 or bigger classes, which was a normal before the covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mission and goal is simple, even if one person felt like they had some piece, he doesn't care about the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;No end to the suffering cycle.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/Me9WOUZhii2uQ18sHqokt1I2-Ys?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1317s"&gt;21:57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no end to the suffering cycle. The human mind and the beast are constantly going out, especially in new york city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahara is just filling the mind within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tapping into the spiritual energy within us.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/Me9WOUZhii2uQ18sHqokt1I2-Ys?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1444s"&gt;24:03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New york city is the perfect place for yoga. It comes with a lot of experience and pain, so the motivation is coming from the lineage connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sivananda is one of the very authentic, authentic, I know the lineage, so it is a very authentic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoga in New York is all about the mind, the mind and emotions, and how the mind gets captured by the objects and stays there for years and then we wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things to learn from authentic sources, get to the spirituality of the person and stay centered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</text>

              <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serge  0:00  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Well, my American name is Serge Cashman. And that's more or less my Israeli name. My Ukrainian name was Serhiy  Izyumov. So, which nobody can pronounce in English, so I'm using search gas fine. And after graduating from a stuff by 500 hours course and some in training with Sara powers, I started teaching first Avista and like a couple of other local studios. And one of those studios was closing. That was about like, four years ago now, four and a half. They were just running out of business, it was run by too. Old Benny and women, like sisters, and they just they ran out of steam, and they wanted to close it. And I was teaching there and it wasn't Sunset Park. And there were pretty much no studios in Sunset Park when I moved in into the neighborhood maybe like 11 or 12 years ago. So they kind of asked me if I wanted to take over the studio. And I said no, because you know, if you if you fail, like what makes you think that I'm gonna succeed. And then they told me that actually, it was a live workplaces. So there was a space to live space to store your stuff in a basement. And you can use it as a yoga studio and as a space to set up, like therapy or Massage Studio or whatever. And it was a very beautiful space. Like you've seen it, you know, what a beautiful view or on the beautiful Greenwood Cemetery. And I decided at that time, I was working as an emergency manager for a trucking company and, you know, it's it's hard to imagine a job that's more challenging and stressful as an emergency manager for a trucking company. So I figured like managing a yoga studio should not be that freakin difficult. Like, you know, and I know love yoga studio owners and I work full of yoga studios and I taught several yoga studios. So I decided like, Okay, I'll do it for a maximum I'll go broke and do something else after that. And that was kind of I was scared that I'm gonna go broke in like three months because, you know, I don't know who's gonna you don't have like an idea of steady client base or anything like this, you just you essentially have a mailing list of people who used to come to the studio hopefully they're going to keep going to the studio and hopefully you're gonna get like new people. And as bad as a businessman that I am, I did have an idea that Sunset Park was gentrifying very quickly you know, essentially the the Park Slope was going up you know, so, like some places a bit became south slope and then someplace has become a Greenwood heights and whatever. So, you know, the people the type of people who do go to yoga classes are moving in. And I thought like it would make sense to like catch the WAV and the pretty much the only studio in the area that people can go to. So, I gave it a try and we were struggling in the beginning because you know the clientele because we had to change a bunch of teachers and the clientele had to change too. And I had a feeling that we were going in the right direction because every every new business you know you need like a year or two just build a brand identity and build a following and stuff like this and attract the right employees. And I felt we were moving in the right direction with like, we had like great teachers. And we had a lot of things going. And I don't know if you know that for for yoga studios, the wintertime, like after January, it's kind of peak time of attendance. Right? We were kind of on the right trajectory, although we got into a significant debt. But it felt like we could get out of this because it was the right timing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Serge  5:48  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;It was exactly the second, the second winter was coming up, and the attendance was growing, the revenue was growing. And people started like noticing us. And we had several teachers have had following. And then, as you might know, the pandemic happened. And all of a sudden, they told us to just shut the whole thing down indefinitely. So from then on, we kind of tried to adapt as as much as we could. For essentially, the Zoom classes, we eventually settled on Zoom, like early on, because Ishta that I was, I was part of like, I used to train and I used to teach at Ishta, then use Zoom for a long time for their Acharya meetings, they have like this tradition, Acharya is, you know, the meeting of the teachers who graduated from the school, so you can come in person. And for those, for those teachers who cannot come in person, they had like the Zoom, the Zoom link to be present. So I was familiar with it, somewhat. So we kind of ended up with Zoom, like most of other people. And then we were not really satisfied with it when we tried to do like a whole bunch of things with it. And it was that pretty like high tack. Eventually, we got to a point where we could have a class in the studio, like informally, and then stream it through zoom and project participants who are online on the wall so people could see like, people in class, see, like, the people online and it kind of it kind of works out. relatively okay. It just was very costly to set up everything. Because it requires more equipment and more importantly, subscription, subscription to more software. So, it was not profitable, but the operation was kind of like still rolling. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serge  8:52  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And later on one of our teachers Mimi decided, like proposed to, in the beginning of the first summer of the pandemic, she proposed to run by donation classes in Sunset Park. And we'll start doing it and it kind of started out slowly and then maybe had to do something else. So Krista took over the classes, and they became quite popular and kind of became a thing. You know, Chi Chi lives in the neighborhood. And we've ran them for I already don't remember, like at least two years, maybe three years. Eventually crystal moved to Harlem. And I took over and then some other teachers started doing what Isabel and some a couple of other teachers started doing saturdays, we were doing Sundays at first. So it kind of kind of became a community thing. And with regular following was always by donation. Without, you know, didn't require pre registration was, you know, in the beginning of the pandemic, a lot of people lost their jobs, you know, technically including ourselves. So we started doing those community classes, and eventually the studio was allowed to reopen, it was very slow to, to reopen. Like, it takes time for people to be comfortable to get back into into the studio. And all of a sudden, we were told by our landlord that we had to close it, because he himself, like his business was doing really poorly, and he had to sell his house. And you wanted to use our space to basically, to live in like, for himself and his wife, his kids, his daughter is already like, in college or whatever. So he doesn't need like the full house. So he sold his house, and he wants to use our ways to live in which she does now. Like he had to renovate the whole space and make it like, livable. And we were given, like two months notice to move out because the lease was up. So yeah, so we moved out, we one of our students gave us a very generous the use of her own space that she was, she just renovated to make the tax office but it was still like a large open space without partitions or anything. So we'll use that for about half a year for like several classes. But it was too far out there was you know, our studio was in the 26th Street, which is kind of still close to Park Slope. And her studio was on, I think 53rd or something like that. So that's too far out for most of the most of the community and community that we were catering to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serge  12:51  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And the locals like like a lot of local community is is just I mean south of south of south slope, a lot of them are not still interested in yoga. It's just like for them it's kind of like the you know, it's like something that rich people do you know. I have a lot of local Latino friends and they just told me directly because that's what it is it just like this is not something that that our people do with obviously a lot of exceptions with tried twice and rather persistently to offer classes in Spanish like so two teachers were trying really hard to like keep going and when we were not successful like the most people who did take their classes were actually like their American English speakers, you know, and and the a couple of people who came who didn't speak Spanish natively were actually from Spain so it was it was kind of you know, I can I tried to make it work? I mean, I guess it doesn't help but I'm like white looking guy. I tried to like offer free introductory classes to like the, the young women that were work that can attack the office next to our studio and like Other like local businesses. And it didn't work, by the way that the student that That offered us the space to teach, he gave it to us for free for like half a year. She's Costa Rican. So she, she's South American, like a, you know, like, once people understand the benefits of yoga doesn't matter, like where you're from. Yeah, but anyways, so everything is eventually like ran out. Like, we we lost the space to teach. We're going to restart the park classes this weekend, we'll see how that goes. We used to stream them to I don't know if you know it, like we used to reuse the stream, the PARCC classes. But last summer, it was very little, there was very little interested in streaming. So we dropped that. But we stream them for like two summers. It was like pretty technically advanced, to be honest, required, like a lot of equipment. And technical know how this kind of a lot involved in setting up. And as that was both live, live music and people talking. Like we had like two really nice Zumba teachers who essentially rented our space and allowed me to take the classes, they actually figured out how to do the streaming music and talk at the same time, but it requires a lot of stuff on the back end. Like he cannot just do it through zoom directly. Like requires, like a lot of like things that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serge  17:03  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I already forgot. But wait, if you really want to do live music. It is enrolled. I don't quite know like one thing that I missed is that a lot of charismatic teachers have stopped teaching even before the pandemic or like scaled down. Like for instance, my, the head of my school, Alan finger, it moved to Florida. Like the school was temporarily shut down, he moved to Florida. They have reopened the school but he's not there. And then, you know, whatever you think about jeevan mukti. But they weren't charismatic teachers and they kind of shut down for a while. I don't know if they reopened or not. But they kind of disappeared. Dharma Mitra moved to like a smaller space. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serge  18:11  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And then even before the pandemic, there was like a really nice studio called own yoga. Like around the Union Square, I forgot the name of the woman. She was  charismatic. She moved out of the city a long time ago because of like, the insane rent over there. So and even even like, like the studio is accessible to everybody like Yoga works. Yoga works closed all their studios in New York City, after the pandemic, and it wasn't before that they were closing studios, because of the rent. And Yoga works is kind of important because and that like what are they can say might sound controversial to Yoga works themselves, but you're like the current owners right now. It's like some kind of like a corporate entity. But YogaWorks was open, founded in California and well by Alan Finger. You know, my teacher like they used to teach her when he came to California to become a photographer. And eventually, he sold the studio and he moved to New York. And he found it to be Yoga. But Yoga works succeeded and they became bigger and bigger that became a chain. So eventually they came to New York, and they bought out b yoga as well. And Alan Finger became, again the like part of YogaWorks on the condition that they allow him to teach his own style. And for people who don't know, Alan Finger's like South African teacher, his father founded his ashram in South Africa was like the large Indian population in South Africa. So that kind of like clearly contributed to their research and, you know, attracting the teachers. Anyway. So eventually, like, when I was already practicing yoga in New York, YogaWorks, and Alan Finger split up because they didn't really allow him to teach his own style. And he founded Ishta. And this is where, you know, my first teacher was an Ishta, trained teacher. Some of my favorite teachers are from Ishta. So I decided to take my 500 hours, class training at Ishta. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serge  21:01  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;My first 200 hours were at Namaste, Williamsburg, Yoga and Tranquility center. That was run by Debbie Desmond and her boyfriend. Which I think his name was Jimmy. But eventually, they, first of all, they split up. And second of all, again, the rent was so insane that they, they couldn't maintain the studio so that they have to close it. That that was around 10 years ago, like when they closed. So, so I can't tell you exactly what but, it seems to me like about 10 years ago, I was just a student for a long time. And then my teacher, like, a couple of years after I took my, you know, to 500 hours, teacher training at Ishta. My mentor, Peter Ferko had asked me to teach said, you know, like some of your some of the students that took the class with you already teaching or you know, teaching, and like, basically, he asked me to do it. And at this stage, it's, it's difficult just to have like a rigorous selection process. So first, not only to complete, the 500 hours Ishta training. But you also need to be need to volunteer for community classes to teach for free, for like, several months, I don't remember for like half a year or something. And then, if, if you complete that you can apply for audition to become a teacher. And there's the whole bunch of like, ah, the train 500 hours teachers that like, go through the through the selection process. And they select several. So it's kind of, you know, it's not like, you walk into a studio and you're like, Hey, I'm a yoga teacher. So you already have to have like, a lot of experience behind you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serge  23:38 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So I've been injured about half a year ago, and I've spent a lot of time in bed. Just trying to recoup, recoup. Or they call it recuperate your recuperate. And one thing I ended up doing, for no particular reason is watching a whole bunch of like 70s and 80s kung fu movies, like Hong Kong kung fu movies, because I haven't, I haven't watched them as a kid. You only know like the references from like Wu Tang Clan, and you have like the sound clips and stuff like this and you have like secondhand things if you if you watched like the Tarantino movies or whatever. But the word like the original movies was like people who are real martial artists and the real acrobats and they're doing real, there are stunts and stuff. Anyway. So there is this concept of a student like begging the teacher to take him as a student. You know, like the like. You want to show dedication that you want to be a follower. Like you're not some just guide. Some dude looking at to learn some skills, he just like you, you know, you want to show the dedication and in that respect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serge  25:09  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I kind of see that well, let me give you an example. Do you know how the West came to know about Krishnamacharya? You might know. Krishnamacharya is the teacher of the four most influential teachers in the West. It's obviously I anger, but I'd be Joyce which is astanga. The secrets are, who is Krishna materias son are in anger is his son unwell. And the most important person is injured Devi. It's a Russian woman born in Riga, who eventually ended up in India as an actress and got married to like, Czechoslovak and diplomat. And because of the Royal connections, she got to meet the Maharaja of Mysore. And she knew that Krishnamacharya was like a very distinguished yogi, teaching at Mysore palace. He was teaching a royal kids, boys and she kind of bag not back when she asked Krishnamacharya to teach her. And he absolutely said no. Because, like crystal shows a woman she was all she was a Westerner. And basically he said no way. However, she was friends with his boss, she was friends with Maharaja of Mysore. So she went, she went and complained. And the Maharaja of Mysore went to Crystal Macharia, and they're so limited, I'm afraid you're gonna have to do it, or else. And he took her as a student. And she she became a student after a little bit more than a year, she had to go to China because her husband was transferred to China as a diplomat. She taught Madame Chiang Kai Shek, the president of China's wife, then the Japanese occupation happened. And she started teaching Americans who were detained in the compound was Japanese, like put all the Westerners in like one ghetto, like, luxurious ghetto, but still a ghetto. And she started teaching Americans over there. And after the war ended, she got to know like a bunch of like, high profile Americans, and one of them suggested to her why don't you go to then she was an actress. Why don't you go to Hollywood and she, like, went to Hollywood, and started teaching yoga in Hollywood. To people like Greta Garbo, for instance. And then she published a couple of books. She wasn't America for about seven years. She published a couple of books. First, first one was published 1950s Something like early 50s. And was was titled, brilliant brillante titled Forever Young, forever healthy. And it became a best seller. And then a couple of years later, she she published a book called Yoga for Americans. And, you know, and basically that introduced Krista Macharia to, to the west, because both books were&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serge  29:25  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;best sellers, you know, Marilyn Monroe only book offer and you know, yoga became a thing for like middle class women in America. And once the news got back to India, then, you know, Krishnamacharya students started going into America, and Americans started going to Mysore. To to, to, to study with, well, not Krishna material, but like But sadly, Joyce, you know, my source stronger. And, and then that's how I ended up here. You know, just because one like Russian woman you've gained a Peterson, you've gained a LeBron skier known as Indra Devi. So where was I? Yeah, so the point, what the point of this entire story was, you know, she, she had to, essentially not only bag but like, really bend somebody wrists to somebody's wrists to become a student, and then prove to him that she was worthy of being a student. And she did. She was 36 at the time. Considering what was possible at the time, when the pandemic happened,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Serge 31:01 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;It was surprising how unprepared the technological world was you know, it just, it was, it was really kind of in shambles. And the way zoom became such like a dominant force is because they were like, just most known and like, people had to find a solution in like a week. Yeah, and they looked around was like, oh, Zoom like that. And it wasn't the best solution. It was definitely not the most secure solution. But it's sort of worked.  One of the reasons it did work, and I'm not - I'm not sure because I recently tried Zoom again, and I realized they changed a lot of stuff. One of the reasons Zoom works is because you could sign into a one account with multiple devices. So for example, a studio couldn't have a camera, which is mostly the rear camera of the, of the phone to show the, the, the teacher to the students, a headphone like bluetooth headphone, you only need one. So you can hear with your other ear, like what else is going on. Connected to the phone, you have a laptop or a tablet in front of the teacher so they can see the students you can have a projector projecting to the wall. So like everybody else can see the online students. And you have another device where the manager could monitor the situation fix the errors admit the students or, or would you call it like if you want to remove somebody can remove somebody? It didn't happen to us actually, like it didn't happen. For some classes, we've shared the links publicly and it was a little bit disturbing because I've heard stories about like people kind of abusing the situation It hasn't happened to us, but like in case it happens you do need somebody to like monitor and be able to get people out so big just because it was so lacks it was actually quite functional and and very interactive. It's not as lax right now, right now if you, if you sign in with different devices on the same account it, it kind of signs you out from the first device. Sometimes, sometimes it doesn't like everything with Zoom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serge 34:30&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So also doesn't record at the same quality that it broadcasts. Which you know, with something like WebEx we tried WebEx and we were happy with it, and it's about the same price but nobody knows what WebEx is. So it's much, much more technic- It's much more developed, I would say. Or at least it was I think you know yoga. Yoga is an ominim that's not like a definitive description of something like the word yoga place to like very different things. So you shouldn't like go to one class, see what's going on and decide it's not for me because yoga refers to like, several completely different things. So I would say, from my experience, it's important to find the teacher and the community who can relate. Because there's no such a thing as like yoga in general. You know, Kundalini, Bikram, Ashtanga, there have pretty much, almost nothing in common. Or like people talking about Bhagavad Gita, that's like a completely other thing. You know, the Yoga Sutras is a again, a completely other thing. So it's not eventually, it's kind of personal. It's, it's some kinds of knowledge transmitted from one person to another person, three generations. And some of it may resonate with you. Some of it may not. You have to be critical. You have to be receptive. And everybody can find something that is worthwhile for them. And will it will make their life more meaningful&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Serge is known as serge cashman in Israel and Serhiy Izyumov in Ukraine, which nobody can pronounce in English.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Serge started teaching at a local studio four years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking over a yoga studio.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/sAF9OTumm2-2EV0Flnquv3V9b8s?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=88s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;1:27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;How Sunset Park was gentrifying quickly, and how he was scared that he would go broke in three months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Why he decided to take over the studio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They were struggling in the beginning because they had to change a bunch of teachers and the clientele.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Every new business needs a year or two to build a brand identity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The start of the Zoom classes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/sAF9OTumm2-2EV0Flnquv3V9b8s?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=375s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;6:14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The pandemic forced them to shut the whole thing down indefinitely, so they had to adapt for the zoom classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They eventually settled on zoom for the classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;One of the teachers proposed to run donation classes in Sunset Park in the beginning of the first summer of the pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The classes became quite popular and became a thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moving out of the studio.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/sAF9OTumm2-2EV0Flnquv3V9b8s?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=646s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;10:46&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;It takes time for people to be comfortable to get back into the studio. They were told by their landlord that they had to close it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They were given two months' notice to move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yoga for the Latino community.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/sAF9OTumm2-2EV0Flnquv3V9b8s?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=762s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;12:42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga is too far out for most of the community and community that they were catering to, and the locals are not interested in yoga.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga for rich people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The student that offered them the space to teach gave it to them for free for like half a year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They are going to restart the park classes this weekend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The decline of charismatic yoga teachers.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/sAF9OTumm2-2EV0Flnquv3V9b8s?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1033s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;17:12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;A lot of charismatic teachers have stopped teaching even before the pandemic or have scaled down or shut down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;YogaWorks closed all of their studios in New York city after the pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga works split up because the rent was too high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How he became a yoga teacher.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/sAF9OTumm2-2EV0Flnquv3V9b8s?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1298s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;21:37&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;About 10 years ago, he was a student for a long time and a teacher for a couple of years after taking his 500 hours teacher training.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The selection process for yoga teachers. His mentor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The concept of a student begging the teacher to take him as a student, and how the west came to know about Krishnamacharya..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;How the west got to know Krishnamacharya.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The maharaja of mysore,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga became a thing for middle class women in America, and once the news got back to India, Krishnamacharya students started going to America.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga for Americans and yoga for the west.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The story of a Russian woman who became a professional skier, and how the pandemic changed the way Zoom became a dominant force.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Zoom is not the best solution, but it did work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Zoom works?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/sAF9OTumm2-2EV0Flnquv3V9b8s?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1939s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;32:19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;One of the reasons Zoom works is because you can sign into a one account with multiple devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Zoom is functional and interactive, but not as much as laz right now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga refers to several completely different things, so it is important to find the teacher and the community who can relate to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga is an ominous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                    <text>Shelly Yang Form + Flow Studio Owner Interview Transcript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[00:00:00] My name is Shelly Yang. I started Form and Flow in [the] summer of 2019 and we are a wellness yoga and mindfulness studio. We're in Long Island City in Queens. A good six, seven months, It built really great momentum and then COVID hit and we closed for almost a year and then reopened in 2021. Some people they they move out of the area due [to] personal reasons. So people come and go. But yes, we had online classes. It was not very well attended. It was very difficult to build a community and following during that time. But we are so blessed with the most amazing team of teachers and facilitators and they were willing to teach every single day for a huge pay cut. They were still there, still show up for even if it's just 1 or 2 students online, they will still teach no matter what. In the studio and during COVID, we would have very few, maybe 1 or 2 students that were willing to also just come in and practice privately with the instructors. And our landlord helped, so we pulled through. We were just blessed, so very grateful. Like we're not a franchised, commercialized yoga studio. We don't have the budget to, like, set up this whole online equipment, like high tech stuff. So sometimes the quality is a bit low for a live stream. Students. So I would feel responsible. I feel bad sometimes if the quality is not as good, but in-person is definitely preferred. So it was like some people were just paying a few dollars for a class, but we're really just wanted to keep it going and.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[00:02:03] Sometimes I'm very naive. It never occurred to me that we wouldn't make it. It was like, of course we'll make it to - to reopen. So we'll just keep doing it and then it'll be okay. We love this community. It's really the best. Beautiful people and the practitioners that come to this space are mostly curious and open. They are beginners, so they're very open to receive and willing to learn. So we love this community, very friendly. It's a happy vibe and you feel it the moment you step in to our studio. It's a it's a very joyful, uplifting vibe. Chinese is my native language and there's so many Asian - there's a big Asian community here. And I always thought about just teaching myself to teach a class in Chinese. I speak fluent. It's my native language and I don't know the technical term. Thinking about, so when we have we've had a few sound meditations here where people on wheelchairs would come in through this door and they would sit in their wheelchair for our sound and Reiki sessions. And that was incredibly powerful healing to them. They were in tears after and this has happened a few times. So it's very sometimes it's even to me when I'm witnessing, when I'm watching and observing this happen, I was like, Wow, like, good job, Shelly, for creating the space and opportunity to allow that to happen. Like to allow people with disabilities to come and participate in these modern healing modalities. Right? I think. It's a very profound field. And yoga, it's not just asana, right? As we know, it's not just a physical practice. So I would really love to encourage people to dive into the deeper layers of themselves. And it might not be smooth sailing. You might realize who you truly are. You might even be a bit scared by what you will discover about yourself, your environment, your surroundings, maybe your family, your loved ones, your friends. But this path is a beautiful path to [un-un-] unveil to peel the layers of the self. And that's what the yoga, philosophy, Buddhism philosophy teaches us to look so deep into who you are and reach for that light. I think that's what we're here in this lifetime to do, rather than surfacing on the societal things, rather than working 9 to 5 or making money or providing for something. But what is there more? What is your true mission or purpose in this lifetime? What is what are you here really to do? I think yoga is a great starting point to quiet down our mind to to tune out from the external stimulus so that we can make a distinction between [distinction] between the outer world and our inner world.</text>

              <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Shelly Yang Form + Flow Studio Owner Interview.mp4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Transcript of Interview &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Shelly: [00:00:00] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;My name is Shelly Yang. I started Form and Flow in [the] summer of 2019 and we are a wellness yoga and mindfulness studio. We're in Long Island City in Queens. A good six, seven months, It built really great momentum and then COVID hit and we closed for almost a year and then reopened in 2021. Some people they they move out of the area due [to]   personal reasons. So people come and go. But yes, we had online classes. It was not very well attended. It was very difficult to build a community and following during that time. But we are so blessed with the most amazing team of teachers and facilitators and they were willing to teach every single day for a huge pay cut. They were still there, still show up for even if it's just 1 or 2 students online, they will still teach no matter what.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Shelly: [00:01:08]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; In the studio and during COVID, we would have very few, maybe 1 or 2 students that were willing to also just come in and practice privately with the instructors. And our landlord helped, so we pulled through. We were just blessed, so very grateful. Like we're not a franchised, commercialized yoga studio. We don't have the budget to, like, set up this whole online equipment, like high tech stuff. So sometimes the quality is a bit low for a live stream. Students - so I would feel responsible, I feel bad sometimes if the quality is not as good, but in-person is definitely preferred. So it was like some people were just paying a few dollars for a class, but we really just wanted to keep it going.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Shelly: [00:02:04] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Sometimes I'm very naive. It never occurred to me that we wouldn't make it. It was like, of course we'll make it to - to reopen. So we'll just keep doing it and then it'll be okay. We love this community. It's really the best. Beautiful people and the practitioners that come to this space are mostly curious and open. They are beginners, so they're very open to receive and willing to learn. So we love this community, very friendly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Shelly: [00:02:41] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;It's a happy vibe and you feel it the moment you step in to our studio. It's a it's a very joyful, uplifting vibe. Chinese is my native language and there's so many Asian - there's a big Asian community here. And I always thought about just teaching myself to teach a class in Chinese. I speak fluent. It's my native language and I don't know the technical term. Thinking about, so when we have, we've had a few sound meditations here where people on wheelchairs would come in through this door and they would sit in their wheelchair for our sound and Reiki sessions. And that was incredibly powerful healing to them. They were in tears after and this has happened a few times. So it's very sometimes it's even to me when I'm witnessing, when I'm watching and observing this happen, I was like, wow, like, good job, Shelly, for creating the space and opportunity to allow that to happen. Like to allow people with disabilities to come and participate in these modern healing modalities. Right? I think. It's a very profound field. And yoga, it's not just asana, right? As we know, it's not just a physical practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Shelly: [00:04:16] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So I would really love to encourage people to dive into the deeper layers of themselves. And it might not be smooth sailing. You might realize who you truly are. You might even be a bit scared by what you will discover about yourself, your environment, your surroundings, maybe your family, your loved ones, your friends. But this path is a beautiful path to [un-un-] unveil to peel the layers of the self. And that's what the yoga, philosophy, Buddhism philosophy teaches us to look so deep into who you are and reach for that light. I think that's what we're here in this lifetime to do, rather than surfacing on the societal things, rather than working 9 to 5 or making money or providing for something. But what is there more? What is your true mission or purpose in this lifetime? What is what are you here really to do? I think yoga is a great starting point to quiet down our mind to to tune out from the external stimulus so that we can make a distinction between [distinction] between the outer world and our inner world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction to form + flow.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/qlhmWulM4BhjT7KHgC-CHADcT4o?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;0:00&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Form + flow is a wellness yoga and mindfulness studio in the city of Queens. Shelly Yang is the owner and co-founder of the studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How they pulled through.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/qlhmWulM4BhjT7KHgC-CHADcT4o?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=83s"&gt;1:22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are not a franchise commercialized yoga studio. They don't have the budget to set up high-tech equipment, so the quality is low for live-stream students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They love the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yoga for people with disabilities.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/qlhmWulM4BhjT7KHgC-CHADcT4o?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=172s"&gt;2:51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese is her native language, and there is a large Asian community in Queens. She always thought about teaching a class in chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoga is a profound field and not just a physical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoga is a beautiful path to peel the layers of the self. It is a great starting point to quiet down the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between outer world and inner world.&lt;/p&gt;

              <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interview Transcript / Summary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas  0:01  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;My name is Tom or Thomas Sutherland. I was the second owner I acquired a small boutique studio on the Upper East Side called Medicine for the Soul Yoga on 84th between second and first. Medicine for the Soul was originally started by two sisters in 2018, in september 2018, who were just absolutely amazing. It was, it was Kristin and Amanda Vasquez who started the studio. And they had just come out of their training their 200 hour training. Amanda was also a certified Reiki teacher, I think she was level two or level three. And Kristin was more of a power yoga, and yin yoga, because that was, that was always a nice mix kind of teacher. And so they wanted to open up their own space, they started teaching gosh, probably 15-20 classes a week when they first started. And they were also going to school, and they had full time jobs. I know Kristin was a nurse, and I think Amanda was doing something in, in a more of a legal side. But they had their hands full as we as we tend to do as New Yorkers. We tend to do many things at once. But after a year, they had about five, six teachers. They were, you know, when I started to become interested, you know, when they put up the studio for sale, they had about 11, 12 classes a week, and they were just doing whatever they could to, you know, to keep going. And they really wanted to see Medicine for the Soul continue on. They didn't want to close it, you know, I think financially, they, they weren't making ends meet.  You know, despite the studio's revenue itself, and then they just had so much going on, I think they really needed to finish school and they wanted to, you know, they had had some other priorities going on. And they're also new to New York, which was not easy. You know, it takes it takes time. You know, they say you don't become a New Yorker until you're there for 10 years, right? Walked your, walked your million step around the city. So yeah, I came in and, you know, we had a really, really nice agreement. You know, I acquired the studio, as we started on September 1. My partner, my girlfriend, Shavonne, was a really big helper, kind of a mentor, in a way, you know, kind of a coach because she was also living in she's, she was there for, like, 11 years, you know? This is around the time that her and I met started hanging out and started dating. And yeah, we just took on this project with, with a lot of inspiration. And it was something that I had always wanted to do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  2:55  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;My first training was in hot yoga in 2012. So I think at this point, 2023 I've been practicing yoga for about 14 years been teaching, or was teaching for about 11. And, yeah, this is something I've always wanted to do. So I acquired Medicine for the Soul, and I met with the teachers, you know. We carried on with the same schedule, and, you know I've always seen people go into a business acquisition, and they just change things, you know, considerably and instantly. But I knew that, you know, you have to keep the essence of what the business is, you know, the essence of what Medicine for the Soul is and the energy and the community. And, you know, what, what it means and just kind of, you know, worked out that my vision was very much in alignment with what Kristin and Amanda were doing, and giving a lot of freedom to their teachers delivering more authentic, yet affordable classes and other some not very affordable classes in New York. It can, it can range in price, but, you know, we we were surrounded, at the time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  4:02 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I was also managing a studio, don't, don't tell them. I was managing the YogaWorks, Upper East Side studio, and I acquired Medicine for the Soul at the same time. So it was, I was, you know, during my lunch break, I would run up to 84th Street from 78th street to go clean the studio, you know, and then run back to go check in for the you know, 12:30 class kind of thing. And then afterwards at five I'd leave. You know, because those classes until 8:30-9 o'clock and then after after I leave around five or six and they're all good for the evening with the front desk staff. I'd run back up and then check people in for the 6:30 and 7:30 You know, just nuts as we do. Yeah, it was just, it was a great experience. I really, I really, really enjoyed you know, having the studio we you know, like I said we acquired in September 2019. So this was, you know, just a few months before the big the big change you which was ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  5:00  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I still remember the date it was March, March, it was a Tuesday was a March 16. Which is when, you know, we all got the call and the message that we had to shut down. But, you know, we basically went from September, I think February was our first profitable month is incredible. We went from, you know, 11, 12, 13 classes a week with five, six teachers, including myself, to 22 teachers and about 45 classes a week. So it was just a huge, it was yeah, it's just a massive turnaround. And, you know, what I was saying is we were surrounded by kind of the best yoga in New York, you know? We were surrounded by, we had YogaWorks down the street. We had Lululemon that's just not Lululemon, what do they call it? Laughing lotus, that's the one, you know, so that they opened up on 80th. I think they're on 84th and Lexington, actually, they're on fourth and Lex. And then you had Pure Yoga, which is on 86th and third. And you had a couple other, you know, Mom and Pop boutique studios down the street on first. Anyway, you had kind of the best, and they had CorePower, which was, you know, taken over there like Subway. And you know, and they're just on every corner. And, you know, we just had the best yoga in New York kind of right around us. You know, I think the only one that was missing probably would have been Yoga Vida. You know, we also had Y7, you know, which is right, there is also a studio on 86th and Lex. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  6:41  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So anyway, we had all this, we had all these, you know, competition. And we're just a small ground, ground floor, very visible, very, very open very loud, you know, space on 84th Street. And it was, it was a quiet street, but still being being kind of front and center. You know, you basically just walk in, there's no lobby, you're, you're in the studio. You know, it's just, it was about 900 square feet. And yeah, it was just, it was an incredible experience. But yeah, so come February, you know, we started, we started making a profit, things were looking good. I'm like, alright, cool! Actually, you know, to be honest, I started looking for a second space, I started looking on the west side, because I think that was an area that had a lot of potential for, for small yoga studios like this. And I looked at, I looked at about four or five different spaces. And you know, nothing, just nothing really felt right, nothing kind of gelled with me. And then, you know, things started to, to kick off. And, you know, that was that was that, that was, that was history. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  7:34 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So, when the, when the pandemic came, it's a funny story. It's a funny, but, but not so funny story. I remember the weeks prior to, you know, March 16, there was a lot of dis uncertainty, I'm sure everyone remembers that. Especially if you're running a business, you know, there's a lot of, you know, in a, in a very hands on, you know, intimate type of business, you know, where people are very close. And, you know, there's a lot of air being shared, you know, a lot of, you know, sweat and, you know, whatever. Germs, I'll say, and is very uncertain, and people didn't really know what COVID was, and you could kind of, you know, you're right? Remember, remember all that? Like, you start to hear rumors and like stories about what's going on. And, you know, I made it, I made a choice early on that, look, it's your choice. As a teacher, if if you want to teach, you're welcome to teach, I have to, I have to run a business. I have to, I have to pay rent, you know. We're not going to get any break for our rent. But if you don't want to teach, please let me know, please communicate that, you know, be clear about that. And, you know, that's okay, because we can reduce the schedule. So I know that a lot of studios kind of just shut down immediately, you know, you know, which is fine. This, everyone had their own choice. You know, it was very unclear about what what to actually do. You know, the final decision came when the government mandate came out just to be had to be actually shut down. Which, you know, we, we did, and, you know, we we started quickly. I think after a couple days, you know, everybody was kind of was was really in alignment about what to do. It was, you know, the first thing that everyone started doing was teaching online classes. Which, you know, everyone was everyone was talking about it, right? It was almost like the whole community came together, you know? Which was not just yoga studios, it was, it was like martial arts and karate studios, it was gyms, it was, you know, recreation centers. It was all sorts of sports and activities, you know. They all kind of came together and said, you know, personal trainers too, and said, What do we do? It's like, well, we got to, we got to take this video. And, I mean, God, it was only three years ago, right? It was so primitive, you know, like, we're all teaching on Zoom. You know, remember that it was like, you know, for them as a business. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  9:58  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;That was, that was massive you know. They, they really just launched and I remember they had all sorts of problems because there was too many people, you know, actually using using their servers. Yeah, we started teaching on, on zoom We started incorporating other types of technology, we actually started streaming live classes with our, with our phones, where we could just set it up on a tripod, and then just, you know, just, we're using couple other services, because we also found out that people didn't actually want to be on Zoom, or if they weren't, if they came on Zoom, they didn't want to talk to anybody or be seen, they didn't want their cameras on. So we kind of incorporated dual technology, which I'm a kind of a tech guy, I'm a techy guy, I, I brought both these technologies into into our website, which was on Squarespace at the time. You know, so, so pretty basic functionality, and abilities. But, you know, we brought in another piece of technology called Box cast, which I didn't know until about a year after using it that it's mostly used for, for, like church services. It's, you know, basically, you can set up, you know, big time, you know, production cameras, you know, film film cameras, or you can use something like your phone or just a webcam. And you sit, it's simply the streaming service and people watch on the other side, and then you just kind of embed it into your, into your website. So we were using that. And that actually turned out to be really turned out to be really popular. And what was great about this service with blocks cast is that every class was recorded. And we had that option to with Zoom, but the quality wasn't great. And I learned very early that in order to succeed with online classes, you had to make the quality higher. So a lot of studios started turning, you know, studios, as businesses started tuning, turning their studio rooms into like, production, you know, production studios, and started setting up really nice cameras, you know, super elegant backgrounds, nice lighting kits with, you know, the umbrellas, and, you know, the whole thing, right, the whole nine yards, and then you know, you had to get really good sound too. So you brought in the high quality microphones and you know, all sorts of audio interfaces and all that kind of software and technology. I think one of the best examples early on someone that a studio a snot, not necessarily a yoga connection here, but someone that I followed for a long time, God has called the class, they did an incredible job. And they actually, at the time of so happening, Vimeo started sort of developing their, their video platform, they had a name for it. And I reached out to them to Vimeo and I had a couple of calls. And, you know, God at the time, you know, everyone was going remote. And I remember that, like sales as a service, you know, like salespeople were just killing it, you know, because they were just because everyone was was adjusting, you know, everyone was everyone was transitioning to a different way of doing things, you know, you couldn't be in person, you know, on a fitness level. And then you had to, you know, transition to more of an at home, do it yourself, you know, as a recording or following a teacher live, you know, on video, and Vimeo just killed it. I remember the class did amazing, amazing job in their transition, their development. And they, you know, they were able to be they had a big, they had a large community. So they had a lot of contacts and data to, you know, to reach out from but they brought in all sorts of producers and super high quality equipment in a day just made, like some of the best quality classes I saw during the pandemic. And, you know, quickly others started to catch on. But ours, for us, it always just stayed very, it was it was basic, but it was authentic. And, you know, we stayed within our community and just tried to get the same students that we had going to our in person classes to come to our online classes. Yeah, so that was that was kind of the transition from purchasing the studio and six months later, not even, you know, going to an online an online platform. I mean, it was amazing. I I'm always grateful for the teachers that that I've met and that worked for medicine. You know, for me as a as a backup make this longer. For me, is it as a teacher and as a studio owner, you know, I've managed different studios for other people, you know, including Yoga works, which was a public company before they I think they might still be or they might have gone private. I think they're only like one or two studios left of YogaWorks ones in Los Angeles. I think they're mostly an online platforms too, as well. But But, you know, for me that one of the big question was, you know, I didn't I, when I, when I developed a schedule, especially for medicine, it wasn't, I try not to make it about me. So not to make it about what I wanted to see being taught, you know, or, or the curriculum that I wanted to deliver, I always ask the teacher the question, What are you teaching? You know, I know, your 200 hour 500 hour train, that's great. Cool, you know, there's millions of us, right? But what are you teaching? Like? What's what's, what's the purpose of your class? Like, why? Why do? Why do students come to your class? What do they get out of it? You know, and I don't ask this question until I've taken their class, probably five or six times, they're not to give any feedback for, you know, at least a few weeks, so I can get to know the person. And then what happens is, we know when they start coming into, you know, when we start having that conversation, they start coming on board with medicine, I give them the freedom to create their own class, you know, from the title of the class, to the description, to what they teach. And when I take the class, and I give feedback, I'm always looking out for what are you teaching, you know, what, what, what's the, what's the authentic voice that you have in this class hear from so for me, it's not so much as a as a workout, as it is a, you know, kind of a message, or, you know, a certain teaching, you know, and it can be physical, it can be emotional, spiritual, you know, psychological, whatever it is, or it can be nothing, you know, sometimes teaching, nothing is the best thing. But that was that was how we developed our schedule. And that's how we kind of grew our community. So I was very grateful that our teachers stayed with us. And actually, like, we're so happy to teach online, and we're so persistent. You know, through, gosh, probably over two years, you know, that we operated online. You know, yeah, it was, it was incredible. I mean, there's, there's a couple stories I'll share, you know, that, that happened along the way that kept elevating us to the next level, we, you know, medicine started to it always, I think the energy always stayed the same, but its purpose shifted, you know, it's, it's, its foundation changed, I mean, stayed the same as a studio and as a, as a platform for people, you know, students to come and learn yoga, into into experience yoga for, for what it is that the teachers were delivering, right. But it's but its purpose, you know, the way that the way that it found others changed along the way. And, yeah, it was just incredible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  17:44  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So I'd say, you know, probably, I think in the, in the, in the very beginning, probably 60%, you know, of probably 60-70% of the teachers that we had initially stayed with us. And I started to transition the site over to WordPress, which is kind of a more open source, it's very popular, you know, what most, most most websites are built on nowadays. And I started to, you know, dig into, like how Netflix works. And, you know, they, they use a hosting service called Amazon Web Services, it's owned by Amazon. And I started to develop the very same technology. So I was using Zoom, and I was using this service called Boxcast, and I was embedding it into our website. And then I was, you know, taking those recorded classes, and I was editing them, and then I was posting it on to, you know, Amazon Web Services.  Basically, just an upload, and then it was doing all sorts of cool stuff in the back end, that would, you know, make, that would make the video just immediately available, no matter where you were in the world. So I don't know, like, if you, and then without buffering, too, it's kind of a huge part of having a streaming service, like on on Netflix, sometimes you'll click play and like, it's fuzzy in the very beginning, it's because of their technology to deliver the content to you as quick as possible without. Without reducing the quality of the video. So and that's, and that's the same thing that we did. So otherwise, if you just click play, you know, and you have slow internet, it would take a while to buffer. But if you, you know, with this technology, you can just press play, and it would just immediately start playing. So we developed that and, you know, started making things globally available. You know, and then I started reaching out for more teachers, actually, you know, I mean, teaching online is so much different than it is teaching in person. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  19:37  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And you know, I mean, sad to say, but it's, you know, some time, a lot of it actually is about personality. It's about looks. It's about how you carry yourself. It's about your confidence, and then you know, sad to say online it's it's it's a little bit more of a workout, you know? If it is in person, you know, there's I guess there's less to feel, you know, person to person, but, you know, you're kind of looking for, you know, especially on a pandemic. I mean, you know, I think looking back, we all underestimate how anxious we were, and how stressed out we were, I mean, collectively. You know, as well, it's not just personally, but it's like, you know, we're all going, I mean, we all that phrase was said, you know, million times a day, "We're all in this in this together." And it's like, you know, we were, and when you look back, you're like, wow, I was just, you know, just really so tense, you know, not, not just, it's not like our fault. It's just like, the situation that we were in. So, one of the cool things, you know, we started bringing on more teachers, and I started to one things I would do, and I was send out these cool microphones, the same microphones that Equinox uses for all their classes. And I would, it was, I mean, I spent so much money, you know, just like sending out all this equipment, you know. But we started to get more and more subscriptions. We set up an online subscription model. I think we were like, $14.99 a month, or like, $149 a year. Which, you know, is pretty, I guess, was a little bit lower than most. A lot of the mom and pop shops were studios, were like, you know, $100 a month, or, you know, $125 a month. Whereas some of the bigger platforms, like The Class, you know, or YogaWorks, or Corepower. Like, they were all, they were all advertising it, you know, $19.99 or $12.99, or, you know, $29.99 a month. You know, and so, like I wanted to, I wanted to be more accessible. And that's kind of what, you know, Medicine for the Soul was. It was just really accessible, really authentic, grounded studio. So I kept that same model and just tried to beat you know, the market with with our pricing, and just tried to, you know, focus on quantity over over, you know, quality in that sense. And one of the coolest things that happened to us is we got approached by a company based in California in the Bay Area called Cloudera, which is a, they're a cloud based technology service. You know, they're a tech company. So they're from Silicon Valley. And they have about 1200 employees around the world. And they have a lot of developers in India, a lot of people in China and Japan, most of their staff is in America and Canada. You know, but they have people down in South America. They have offices over in, in Europe, and they came to us and they said, Look, you know, we, I was advertising on Google, on Google Ads and stuff, which is how they found us. And they said, Look, you know, we like we, you know, this is what we're looking for. We want to give our people, you know, that at the time they were, and everyone did this, a lot of companies did this, they started to open up a whole benefits package for their people, you know, which was fitness classes, which was like personal therapy, which was like at home meal delivery services. I mean, gosh, the list goes on, you know, people just trying to give his many purchase online cooking classes, you know, like all sorts of stuff, right? Like, like, the list goes on. And Cloudera said, Look, we want to give our people some yoga and fitness classes, we like what you have to offer? Can you guys, you know, can you give us and I'm just, you know, making a summary here? Can you give us a pricing plan for all of our people? And can can is your website accessible to all of our staff? And this is like 1200 people, right? So it's a big change from, you know, a 900 square foot studio in Upper East Side, you know, with with a maximum of 15 students in the class, you know, to now like, as an online platform. You know, with a, with a brand new website and WordPress now serving, you know, the potential to serve, you know, 1200 people around the world. And, you know, we did the, we did the deal. We, I think it was $1,000 a month they gave us and that was like, That was everything. And I was like, Wow, maybe this is where, you know, Medicine's going. And, you know, corporate wellness was becoming a huge thing. I know that teachers, especially in New York, did this, you know, on an in person, like, you know, in person basis, you know, just small classes, right? But then corporate wellness as an online offering just blew up just became huge, you know. Like a lot of online personal therapy became really huge. You know, online fitness became huge and a few what's the, what's the one there was like the the website Calm, the service Calm. And this was so what's the meditation one, if you hit them for what it was called? So with a DJ, this is, man, I love this. It was like part of my part of my passion. I still love to, you know, just kind of mixing music every now and again. But um, we had a really great teacher who really just started she actually taught our our set get to last class in the studio. Um, her name is DSS skin and she's um she's quite well known she's she's a big Instagrammer, she's just the sweetest. I think she's what's the super posh brand? The yoga brand yeah oh yeah, yeah I mean I'm sorry as you can tell I'm not like a normal yogi. I've dipped into many things in my life but you know ALO, so she's, she's very well supported by ALO and then also Lululemon and a couple other you know kind of startup brands so she's, she's got quite a following. Ferenc Instagram has just taken off she, she's really big into handstands. But anyway, dia was, she had just done her power training, and she was teaching for us. And when we got online, it's like, she really started to she had just done her training. And when we started getting online, like she just found her voice. And she really just took off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  25:56  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And, you know, I, there was a, there was like a Friday class down in Midtown. That would do yoga with with a DJ. And no, no, sorry, you know what it was? It was one of our teachers use teach a House of Yes. In Brooklyn, teach yoga class with a DJ at House of Yes. And I was like, that's a cool concept. And this was, you know, before the pandemic, and so I just, I reached out to all my teachers said, hey, look, I'm thinking about, you know, starting a Friday night, DJ class, you know, would anyone like to, you know, teach some power to it? And do raise your hand. I was like, that sounds totally cool. So her and I team to actually is on Tuesdays, we teamed up on I think we did it for Tuesdays and Fridays, but then we dropped Fridays, because everyone just wanted to drink on Fridays, you know, like pandemic style. And, yeah, Tuesdays, we did. I think it was power, power, power to the beat, or something, or beat to the power, I forget what it was, but it was amazing. And we had some really cool classes. None of those are saved, because the music's copyright, but we did, we did some really cool stuff. And we had a lot of people join, I mean, sometimes we'd, we would advertise to like the world. You know, that like, "Hey, this is a DJ yoga class, you know, here's the, here's the link." And sometimes we get, like, you know, 2025 people in there. And, you know, sometimes you'd have like, six. It's just kind of ranged from week to week, but we had some really good fun. You know, it was just, it was just blowing up. And so we started to shift, you know, that that direction and start to market ourselves as more of a corporate wellness platform, and we still had the the individual subscriptions, we were doing both. And we started, yeah, we started reaching out. You know, I, I don't even know how we got some of these contacts. But I think, I think I purchased some data from some people. Then I was, and then I was reaching out, you know, just doing a lot of research, I was doing a lot of prospecting myself, and that was kind of my job. Then I wasn't really teaching anymore, I was more, I was more of a, you know, salesperson, you know, just trying to just, this was like, my full time job. And I was just trying to grow it. And I really saw a lot of potential here. So we, I think, at the end, we had, we had six, we had six corporate companies that were that were signed on with us. So we were, you know, had an income of about six to seven thousand a month. And then we were doing, you know, individual like events, you know, for those companies, which, which would, you know, pay us pretty well, pretty well, the teachers would get paid extremely well, if they did, like just kind of a one off corporate class for that company. Kind of like as an event, you know, like, an all hands, you know, like, let's all get together on a Friday afternoon and just for, you know, unplug by plugging into Zoom. So, it was, yeah, go figure. But yeah, that was that was where he went with it. And it was, it was incredible. So yeah, the long story short. Towards, toward, you know, as I always had the feeling underneath all this initiative that this was just a temporary solution. I just didn't know how relevant this all this effort was going to be when when, because the pandemic was going to end. It's just inevitable, you know, people thought was gonna go on forever. You know, like, we'd always been a pandemic, but, you know, it, we would get used to it, you know, and, you know, COVID hasn't gone away, but&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  29:37  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;it's, you know, certainly like I went to a jazz club last night, and it's like, no one had a mask on, and it just felt really relaxed and laid back and there was just no stress at all. Or, you know, having a couple of beers and just enjoying ourselves, you know. It's like, it was just like before, before but different, you know, because we all had to change in perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  30:02  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So, yeah, as things kind of started to wind down, some personal events happened in my life, my father passed away, and I ended up taking over his business, he had a small business in the Bay Area, California. At that point, you know, was trying to actually transition Medicine over to one of our teachers who I thought would do a really nice job in running the studio. You know, kind of long term for herself and the partner that, that she wanted to team up with, but it kind of just fell through, you know, we didn't quite get everything together. By the time that I needed to have things together, you know. Otherwise, there's going to come to additional cost to myself to just kind of keep delaying things. But yeah, so. So we, I have shut down the site, Medicine for the Soul is no longer a website or URL. But I did put, I think there's a few 100 I think, just close to 300 classes, videos on YouTube, so it's all free. Yeah, it's pretty cool. So I've taken kind of, you know, all of the all the on demand classes that we specially edited, and, you know, classes that I would like, sit there with my music mixer, and like, DJ, you know, background music to.You know, for some of our classes and so it's cool see is this Medicine for the Soul Wellness, on YouTube, which is pretty cool. So I think we have like 265 subscribers and 200 videos, I'm not, I'm not active, I really keep it there as a, as an archive as a memento. You know, just for nostalgia. Just to kind of go cool, you know, like, look at look at all that we did, you know, in a very short period of time, well, considering. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thomas  31:47  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I guess, during during my travels, I've taught for a lot of studios, in like, 12 different countries, and I've seen a lot of studios close or, you know, transition to new owners for various, you know, whatever, right. It's just, it's, I mean, this happens in every industry. You know, I sometimes, you know, for me, like, closing Medicine was, was also a closing of, you know, for me, it was it was a, it was kind of an end of a chapter and I knew it. And it was, it was like, it was a really nice thing. And I you know, it was kind of sudden, because I had to shift over to my dad's business and, you know, and work through my dad's passing. But I think I think that's kind of the message there is, is, you know, your studio or where you practice what you owned, or what you had, you know, really has, has, has also brought you to where you are now. You know, and so I look at Medicine as like, you know, it's really something great that I did, you know, that we did not I is something great that we collectively achieved together and like build together, you know, be my girlfriend, my partner, Shavonne and, you know, the the many teachers man, I just can't thank them enough. You know, I think for, you know, for the future aliens that come back. And they, you know, look at a frozen over New York City and say, wow, you know, look at what they used to do with their bodies. You know, I just I'd like them to know that. You know, there was something really special happening on 84th Street. It was, it was pretty cool. And there's a lot of great people, a lot of great students, and it was, it was a lot of fun. It was a lot of hard work, a lot of a lot of a lot of blood and sweat and tears as any business is, but it was, just it was so worth it. And, you know, it's kind of a it's kind of a rite of passage for myself. And I think a lot of the teachers that that taught there and I think they, you know, I think we're all better for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>

              <text>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/AyAuVkVVnrzkdNIAkMhcp1RSa8A?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;0:01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Tom Sutherland acquired a small boutique studio on the Upper East Side called medicine for the Soul Yoga on 84th between second and first avenues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The original owners, Kristin and Amanda Vasquez.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acquiring a yoga studio.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/AyAuVkVVnrzkdNIAkMhcp1RSa8A?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=122s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;2:02&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Acquiring Medicine for the Soul was not easy, and it takes time to become a New Yorker. It takes 10 years to become one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Her first training was in hot yoga in 2012, and she has been practicing yoga for 14 years and teaching for 11.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The turning point of the business.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/AyAuVkVVnrzkdNIAkMhcp1RSa8A?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=281s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;4:40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The studio was acquired in September 2019, a few months before the big change. They went from 11-12 classes a week with 5-6 teachers to 22 teachers and 45 classes per week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They were surrounded by the best yoga in New York, including YogaWorks and Pure Yoga.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;When the pandemic came, there was a lot of uncertainty, especially in a very hands-on, intimate type of business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The final decision came when the government mandate came out just to be actually shut down. The first thing that everyone started doing was teaching online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did you incorporate technology into your business?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/AyAuVkVVnrzkdNIAkMhcp1RSa8A?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=609s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;10:09&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They started teaching on Zoom, and started incorporating other technology. They started streaming live classes with their phones and using other services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They brought in another piece of technology called Box Cast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transitioning from a studio to online classes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/AyAuVkVVnrzkdNIAkMhcp1RSa8A?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=726s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;12:05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;One of the best examples of a yoga studio being successful during the pandemic was Vimeo. They brought in high-quality equipment and made the best quality classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The transition from purchasing the studio and six months later not even going to an online platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The importance of asking the question, what are you teaching? What is the purpose of your class? What do students get out of it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Giving students the freedom to create their own class, from the title of the class to the description to what they teach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning online.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/AyAuVkVVnrzkdNIAkMhcp1RSa8A?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=995s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;16:34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They were able to grow their community and develop a schedule and grow the community by teaching online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;In the beginning, 60% of the teachers that they had initially had initially stayed with them, and she started to transition the site over to WordPress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teaching online is different from teaching in person.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/AyAuVkVVnrzkdNIAkMhcp1RSa8A?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1150s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;19:10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Teaching online is different from teaching in person. It's about personality, looks, confidence and confidence. Online is a little bit more of a workout than in-person classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Medicine started to get more and more subscriptions and set up an online subscription model, which was $14.99 a month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on quantity over quality in pricing.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/AyAuVkVVnrzkdNIAkMhcp1RSa8A?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1291s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;21:30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Medicine for the Soul was accessible and grounded, and tried to beat the market with pricing and focus on quantity over quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Cloudera, a tech company based in silicon valley offered them a contract for their online platform, with a new website and wordpress, serving 1200 people around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yoga with a DJ at House of Yes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/AyAuVkVVnrzkdNIAkMhcp1RSa8A?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1565s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;26:05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;One of the first classes they did was a Friday night DJ class with a DJ at House of Yes in Brooklyn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They had six corporate companies that were signed on with them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zoom’s impact on the business.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/AyAuVkVVnrzkdNIAkMhcp1RSa8A?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1724s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;28:43&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The event was an all-hands meeting on a Friday afternoon to unplug by plugging into zoom. It was incredible, and it was a temporary solution to the pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The site Medicine for the Soul is no longer a website or URL, but there are close to 300 class videos on YouTube.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The Medicine for the Soul Wellness on YouTube channel has 265 subscribers and 200 videos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Closing Medicine was also a closing of a chapter in his life, and it was a right of passage for him and the teachers that taught there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I'm Keela Williams. My studio is New Love City. We're in Greenpoint, 68 Greenpoint Avenue 4th floor. I'm the owner. I actually am not - There was a previous owner, I I bought the studio from her, I took over. I've been there the whole time, I was teaching the whole time, but actually took over January 1 2020. So that was a real ride. Um, but yeah, we'll be, we'll be eight at the end of July. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  0:36  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We decided to do like a clean break of like January 1st, to have it just be like a new year. Um, that January, we had a really good month, I was nuts. I was riding high. I was like this is, it might have been the best month we'd had! But maybe not, I'd have to look back at the numbers. But it was a very good month for us. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  0:57 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Things were going well, in February, I was actually at I was hosting a retreat, a yoga retreat in Palm Springs that March, 2020. And that's when things start to get a little get a little crazy. And I remember my manager of the studio calling and saying like, what do you want me to do? Like, this COVID thing is happening, and I don't know what to do. And I just said buy as muchh and sanitizer as you can and I'll be back in like three days. And I flew back after the retreat, I think we shut down March, I think it was March 16th around there. And then we were shut for 427 days. Not that I was counting. Um, it was really scary and really, like, isolating because I was also the sole owner. And now I have this business on my hands. I'm, I'm in debt, because I took out loans to purchase the business. And you know, there's zero, there's zero money coming in. So, you know, that was that was scary. And hairy. And also COVID was scary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  2:09  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So it was like, the we, I'm fortunate that I have a background in like tech and design, I was a project manager for design studios for like 12 plus years. Before I before became a yoga teacher, and then a studio owner. So I had a little bit of that knowledge already of like how to project manage how to like, how to pivot quickly how to create an online platform. So we very quickly pivoted to online, we just immediately started doing Instagram lives, because that was like the lowest barrier to entry. And we would just set up a tripod and I would teach a class on Instagram Live to these, you know, students at home. We then really quickly figured out that if you very quickly after you in the Instagram Live, if you push download, you could download the whole video. This is not that way anymore, I don't think but this was the technology at that time. So if you're really quick, after you ended it, and you remember it and you downloaded it, which is the thing I taught my teachers, then we would have that hour class. So then we would take that hour class and we would have a library of these classes. So then we built I built a Patreon page. I mean, those times were, those times were wild. I was up all night out to teach and film these classes during the day. I would be up all night like editing them trying to figure out the best way to like get them up quickly. So we then launched our Patreon page, which actually was really successful. Or I should say that our community is very, very loyal and wonderful. And they were like, What do you need, and I was like, I need you to join this Patreon. So at the height of our online subscription, we have like 250 patrons, which was huge. So we kept that going, it's still going, it's still live. We kept that going the entire time. We eventually moved from just doing the Instagram, we were doing like three Instagram lives a day. I think we were doing morning, midday and evening. And our teachers would just teach wherever they were, and then immediately download it and then Dropbox it to me and then I would edit it and put it on Patreon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  4:37  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So you know we have the archive of all those Instagram Lives from 2020 to go back and watch them now it's kind of wild because the tone is so different. The vibe, the mood is like it's a little dark, to be honest. Like it's a little like, ooh, because we're just kind of hanging on by thread and we're like alone teaching these classes in a room alone, and then Instagram Live, there's no there's no interaction. You know, you people, could like heart things and likes comment, but you can't see them. So, yeah, it was we created a lot of content. And I think we did get a lot of people engaged. And we have all that content still, but it was it was definitely like a weird, it was a weird time. We then, our software platform for the studio is Mindbody, they rolled out a live stream, a lot of studios were doing Zoom. Um, I don't know why we've kind of shied away from that I just wanted it to be a little bit more structured. So we did Mindbody live.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  5:47  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And we would live stream some classes from the studio. Those you could see people if you wanted, but usually people, sometimes we turn our camera on, and sometimes it weren't. It's really hard to teach,. and it's really hard to teach an online class when everyone's cameras off. You're just like, yelling into the void. It's really weird. But we did that for a while. And then we set out, we got we got like a proper set up of a proper camera and we set everything up in the studio that's still going. And we would would film proper classes like this. The teacher would go in, they would know what they're teaching, they would shoot themselves doing it. And that way, you didn't have to be around anyone. So you can be isolated in that room. And there is you know, no threat of COVID and then you could shoot your video, and then they would be like. Okay, here's the video, here's the description, here's the title. And then I would edit them, I just taught myself how to edit in iMovie. And then we would just get those up on Patreon. And we actually just did an audit of our Patreon, because we're kind of going through and cleaning it up a little bit. And our I think it came out to like 800 videos, which is like insanity. So we've got quite a lot of content that we shot over those two years. Yeah, that's kind of how we got through regarding the online portion, and that patrons still like we still have, you know, we're we definitely don't have as many as 250 now, but that's because we're open and people come back to the studio, which we prefer. They weren't super popular, we ran them for a little while, we wouldn't get a ton of engagement that way. But we were getting a lot of engagement on Patreon. And so it just seemed like, it seemed like yes, people wanted the interaction. But I think more than that they wanted to practice on their own time. So I know a lot of students who were doing Zooms, and those were like really successful, our live stream never really took off. And was like a little bit of a pain for us. So we eventually just kind of like nixed that and continued just having the teacher fill in themselves. So that we can edit it, put it on Patreon. And they could just take - take class whenever they wanted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  8:02  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We just taught the way the teacher, I encouraged my teachers to teach however they would teach. The whole class would be its own class, the whole class is demoed. So if you are hearing impaired, you can see. But and yes, we would use Sanskrit depending on the teacher, my teachers are allowed to encourage to teach however they want and whatever style and whatever language Sanskrit, English and what have you that they want. So they were just kind of being themselves, and just teaching the classes that they would teach in a studio just online, and having to demo the whole thing, obviously. Which gets a little tiresome after you're holding all the poses. But yeah, people seem to dig it. And people even now have found us via Patreon, and have either joined the studio, or come on a retreat with me. People who I have never even met who like lived in Oregon, started somehow finding our Patreon and then would like they come to Thailand with me every year on a retreat, which is just wild. So they definitely like opened up a bigger audience for us. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  9:15  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yeah, music was a whole thing because music as New Love City is a big part of our culture, it's a big part of our teaching. Most all the teachers teach with, with their own playlists that they create. It's a very big part of my class. And it's a it's, it's honestly why a lot of people come to my class. And I do spend a lot of time on my playlist and then make one every week. And we didn't want to not have that. And so if you do any sort of live stream or do any sort of video production, you can't, you can't use a popular song, a normal song with unless unless you license it and not we can't afford it licenses. So we the workaround for us was to have them play it at home. So we will to create the playlist and send out the link and say like if you want to follow along, and then we figured out that either a live stream or when you are shooting it for them to watch later the on demand. You would say like, Okay, if you're playing with the playlist, go ahead and queue it up and push play and three to one. And everyone pushes at the same time in hopes that like that gets the synchronicity of like moving through the flow and moving through the playlist. And that seemed to work, okay. And we even do that now on Patreon, you can like go click a video, the playlist is at the bottom. So that was our workaround for not having to shell out tons of money for licensing or use those non licensed songs, which we all know aren't as good. Yeah. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  10:50 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;We have one yin class on Sunday nights. We're always vinyasa with a caveat that it's completely up to the teacher. And so, you know, my class tends to be a little bit on the faster side. And then like Conor, whose class you took this morning tends to be on the slower side. And then there's everything in between. I put no stipulation on them. I just asked them to teach whatever they want. The I do, the one stipulation I put on is that they have to teach to all levels. And so all of our classes are all levels. So each teacher will say like, you know, let's go into this pose. If you want to, like level up a little bit, you can try this. And if you want to go and work and try this. So there's always usually two to three different options in each pose, just to make sure everyone feels like it's accessible to them. And they can practice with us. Yes, I do not want us to do this there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  11:41  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So I, Jen Jones is the original founder owner. And you know, I was teaching there from the beginning. She just fell in love with that space. It's a beautiful space, it's fourth floor walk up, which is a little little annoying for some people. You're warmed up by the time you get up there. But this space is stunning. It's like beautiful, all the carpet floors. And there's skylight in each room. And it's a pretty big space, so it can fit quite a bit of people in the class. It's just gorgeous. And you know, Greenpoint, it's like, the best neighborhood in Brooklyn, in my opinion. So yeah, I think we're very fortunate to be where we are. And we're right there. Franklin is kind of like the main strip. So we're just right off of Franklin, which is pretty sweet. And the community in Greenpoint is wonderful to be really sweet, you know, usually a little younger crowd, who are very active and very supportive. And there is also a lot of freelancers, which is good for midday classes. Yeah, it's just it's a sweet, it's a sweet spot, both like in the community and, and location wise. And we are very close to transmitter where like, literally on that street. Funnily enough, the way I knew that that was a really good spot for yoga is I actually got married at that spot. So I knew, I knew it was a beautiful place for people to congregate, because that's sort of where I had my I had my ceremony. So we just decided, yeah, we try yoga there. And, and that worked out and there's a beautiful giant willow tree that unfortunately, fell a few years ago. Yeah, I don't know, if you saw is that she was very, very old. The tree was older than the park. And it fell after one of those big storms, which is a big bummer. We actually donated a new tree to the to the park, a baby willow. So it has been planted in that old spot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  13:42  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;But the library reached out to us and we were thrilled. They're so sweet. They're so wonderful. That library took so long to open. It's actually right...it's like two blocks from my house. So when it opened, I was so excited. It's a beautiful building. They actually reached out to us, and they had a little bit of they had a little bit of budget. And we decided, you know, we would we would match them. And so our teachers, the class is free, our teachers get paid. But the class is open to the public. And we run that programming spring and fall, usually summer on their rooftop is pretty hot. And we just launched kids yoga with them as well. So there's like, like storytime yoga on Thursdays at 11 that one of our teachers teachers, their little little little bitty baby like little like two year olds very cute. So that's like a fun, that's a fun partnership that we have. And even you know they usually have like a little bit of budget and I'm like, fine, like my the ethos at New Love City as a teacher gets paid really well because this is a job that you have to be, you have to do a lot of education, for you have to pay for that education. You, So you have to continue that education. It's just expensive, as you know, to be a yoga teacher in the city. You also don't get paid very well. We're trying to change that. And I do feel proud that we teach, we pay our teachers very well. So I never asked them to teach a class for free, ever. Even if it's a donation class, they always get paid by the studio. And then we can donate the proceeds from the students to whatever charity we choose. Usually this, the teacher will pick. But yeah, that, that partnership with the library is really sweet. We have one starting with the new Greenpoint market, and not this weekend. But next, though, first week in June, where we're going to do, they're doing a wellness weekend. So we're going to do two classes a day, one kids and three adult classes that weekend with them, and that, again, will be free and open to the public. So we're excited about that as well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  15:54  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;One thing that we did was we had these daily meditations on our Instagram that you could just jump on, it was five minutes, all those are still on our page from, you know, years ago. Kwazi, one of our incredible meditation teachers, as well as Conor would lead a lot of those. So every day, it was just a way to like, okay, let's just jump on and connect and meditate for five minutes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  16:18 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;I had some students, I don't one particular student who was a doctor, and she she's a doctor and like the respiratory field. so COVID was really hard for her and she was working so much. And she was really suffering, physically, emotionally, everything. So I would send her voice classes that were like 20 minutes, 25 minutes, just really digestible. Like, hey, like, here's what we're gonna do. And I would sort of send those to her every few days that she had something to do and to practice, like, I have 20 minutes, maybe in the morning, and then I have to go to the hospital, and then there for 8-12 14-16 hours, like who knows. So yeah, I would do that for her, which, which was a sweet way to connect. And then we would have our meditations. And yeah, those are really sweet. I think I had other friends who were like, can you just send me like, a morning stretch? And I was like, absolutely. And voicemail was good for that. Some students needed stuff at home, they're like, can I just borrow was like, absolutely. So they would take blocks home. And then, you know, year and a half later, when we're practicing inside they would they brought them back. So that was nice. Yeah, yeah, there, there's a core group of our members who've been with us, wherever and, you know, a lot of them were like, I'm still working. I have nothing. I have nothing to spend my money on. Because everything is closed. Just keep my membership going. Like, are you sure? And they're like, yes, just please, like, reopen when we can reopen. Please don't close. I was like, I have no intention of closing. So you know, that was nice and sweet. And and definitely helped us keep keep the doors open but closed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  18:15  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;So we turned five, July 2020. And I was like we I mean, we have over five we have celebrate. And so we decided we're gonna have an outside yoga party. So we decided to do the American playground. And that's really close to studio. It's on Franklin. I think is like Franklin in between denoble and Milton. It's cute little playground, there's basketball court. There's a playground for the kids. It's not very big. There's not a lot of people ever really playing basketball on that court. So I was like, oh, we'll just we'll go there. I got us a generator so that we could take our big speakers and just have this big party that a cooler we had a generator. And I asked him to film it. And we all went out and did a meditation. A class, like a class for multiple teachers would teach we kind of just like pass back and forth. And we just did it on the basketball court. But what was funny is that day good for us and bad for us just happened to be beautiful. So everyone was out playing basketball. So we were, like oh well, so we're literally..if you see any of the videos everybody we're like, you can see us like on half of the court taking up the court like people have doing yoga poses. Laying down doing yoga poses, standing up and you know  music on. And then the other court, there's just like ballers just going for it and they're all over the place. We're all over the place and we're just really sweet because we didn't, they just wanted to be outside and we wanted to be outside and we just kind of made it work. Like coexisting in this space is really active space for like people maybe getting hit by a ball but they didn't care. The how is the like, was hot day so the date opened up the fire like the water would what do you call that? The like barracks underwater? Yeah. So that's going and that's like in the video and just just like a really sweet New York day, but at the same time, like the industry, Brooklyn is a Brooklyn time and at the same time, we're all like, with kerchiefs on our noses, but pulled down a little bit, but like, Are we okay? We're in the middle of COVID bubble, we're outside, but we're not close to each other. So it's just a really weird. It's a really weird time. It was really sweet. Time to like, all come together. And I remember that fondly. Yeah, so weird party that was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  20:44  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Then we did so many online trainings, we did. I think we started with a thing called homeschooled. And we basically, it was it, was open to anyone. And it was just a time to sort of get online together and study yoga, it was really sweet. And mostly, it was just a time for people like being in community with each other. I think we ran three of those. We also did detent-yin, which I think might have been what you did. And we might have done two of those. And that was specifically in focus. It was the online course on yin. And then we did, then we did a 200 hour in the fall of 2020. And we did a hybrid inside, we all signed a social contract that we were gonna be really safe There were some rules around like, you know, people that you see in density, so that on the weekends, we could be in the studio. And during the week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, we will be on Zoom. That was one of our most successful teacher trainings we got because of the way we ran it because of the timing people who had like real jobs, so that an air quotes, like day jobs were allowed to join because of the timing. And honestly, it was such a successful teacher training, we got so many teachers out of that training because of that, like I think we hired, which we don't normally do. Normally it's like zero to one. We hired like four teachers out of that training, because they were all just fantastic. They're still with us. Spring 2021, it was most, I think COVID kind of got a little dicey in this, so I think that one was online the whole time. That was hard. That was really hard. And then I think, fall 2021 maybe it was hybrid again. But honestly, all that's so fuzzy, because it was just such a weird time that some of it's like blocked out. But yeah, we did.,,We did fall 2020, spring 2021 fall 2021. And then we've now are just back to doing it in the fall. And it's, it is still hybrid during the week on Zoom and the weekends in the studio. And we found that that works really well again and allows people who normally wouldn't be able to join, to join so that that is actually something that came, a positive thing that came out. Because we would have never done that before we would have never gone online. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  23:20 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Well, one thing I will say, you may or may not want to edit out, is that we don't prescribe to Yoga Alliance. Our teacher training is, this I know, we have the best teachers and they are so smart. And they have studied for so long. Conor, Conor is incredible. He's been doing this for so long. I'm teaching philosophy online. Yeah, easy. He taught anatomy online. He's got like a little, I think he just would share his screen and he has this fun little anatomy app on his computer. And he would just like point to it that way I taught poses online, I would literally just like do the pose and show them what it looked like. And then I would be like, Okay, stand up and you do it. Is it perfect? No. Is it doable? Absolutely. Um, so yeah, there's workarounds. And then, you know, it allows them, it allows them to be able to participate. Rather than it being an in person, you know, eight hours a day on a Saturday and Sunday, which is brutal. I do have some teacher you know, yoga is a funny profession because you do get inspired to travel. Whether that's to go to a training somewhere or go practice somewhere, or just like go travel because you're not sort of stuck to this traditional job. So I do have a teacher who's moving away and she's like, you know, I would still want to be involved like you're still absolutely involved. You know, if you want to host a retreat where you're going, we can do that if you want to, you know, teach them online, so if you can do that, but it has helped us. It has helped us continue to keep the teachers we have but I will say that our teachers, more than anything love to teach in our studio, and just we're so happy that we reopened and came back. And even though we do keep that online portion, like and even though we do keep our Patreon, like, we, we love to be together. We love to be with each other, we love to be with our students, it's a special space. So, you know, that's, that's where our hearts lie. I'm very, you know, grateful that we got some online stuff to help us stay afloat. But we just like to be in person. Yeah, it's the same. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  25:35  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;The only difference is we don't have a 6:30am anymore, because now people don't go to work because of remote. So the thing that shifted is that we don't have a 6:30 because no one would come to it. And our 9:30's are fuller, because people are working remote, the 12:30's are fuller, because people are working remote. What kept me going was our oh, even thinking about it makes me like so overwhelmed. It was, it was hard. It was hard. My, my, my teachers and my students who were like everyone, just that we just missed each other so much, we wanted to be together so badly. And so when we did launch our park program July 2020, and had to go back and look because they all that is like really fuzzy memory, because it was such a hard time that. Like in time was just so squishy then, but when we did launch it. I just went back and looked and I taught these two night classes there. And they were both packed, you know, we tried to cap it because of like people, we didn't want too many people there because of COVID. But like they were both just like, full, because people just wanted to be together. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keela  26:53 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;And, you know, I weirdly like made a lot of new friends during that time, because people who stuck around in New York and then they would come to park yoga, and I didn't really know them very well. And I got to know them really well. So I've blossomed some new friendships. Before, I was very like kind of standoffish with students because I was like, the dynamic of teacher and student and so you don't want to get too close. I kind of feel like COVID like wiped all that away. And now I'm just like, so close to all my teachers. I'm so close to all my students in a really sweet way that, you know, we had to go through a dark time to get there. But I'm I'm very, I'm very happy with the way things ended up. I'm so so so grateful that we are still open. I'm so grateful my teachers stuck with me, that my students stuck with me. And now we're you know, we're all better for it. But, but yeah. Yeah, I think the saving grace for us was we took we took a lot of risks. We went outside, we rolled the dice to see that would work. It worked. We launched the online platform which it worked, it worked. We asked for help wherever we could get it. Like we just kind of we just did everything that we had to do to stay afloat because we knew, I knew we were going to reopen those doors. That had no and I remember one of my teachers asked me and I get really emotional, I think about it, but he's like, did you ever think about shutting? Did you ever think that was possibility? And I said, absolutely not. There was no there was no, there was no chance of it. Like we were just going to reopen. And we did and we are even more successful now than we've ever been. So yeah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/S0y1ZWWKJACimGPTiUydLtNE_NA?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;0:00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Keela williams is the owner of New Love City, a yoga studio in Greenpoint, New York. She took over the studio from the previous owner on January 1, 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;In February, she was hosting a retreat in Palm Springs, and the studio shut down for 427 days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pivoting to online courses.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/S0y1ZWWKJACimGPTiUydLtNE_NA?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=152s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;2:32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;She had a little bit of knowledge of how to project manage and pivot quickly. She quickly pivoted to online and started doing Instagram lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;She was up all night editing the classes during the day, trying to figure out the best way to get them up quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did the online portion of the business go?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/S0y1ZWWKJACimGPTiUydLtNE_NA?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=309s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;5:08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They created a lot of content during the pandemic, but it was a weird time. They did Mindbody live, and they would live stream some classes from the studio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They did an audit of their patreon, and their videos came out to over 800 videos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teaching the way the teacher wants to teach.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/S0y1ZWWKJACimGPTiUydLtNE_NA?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=479s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;7:58&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Teachers are encouraged to teach however they want, and the whole class is demoed. They are allowed to use sanskrit or whatever style they want.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Music is a big part of teaching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;About playlists.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/S0y1ZWWKJACimGPTiUydLtNE_NA?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=574s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;9:34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They make a playlist every week. They also have a playlist for live streams and video production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They give yin class on Sunday nights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Jen Jones is the original founder.. She fell in love with the space and was teaching there from the beginning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Greenpoint is the best neighborhood in Brooklyn, and the community in greenpoint is wonderful, with a young and supportive community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yoga with the library.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/S0y1ZWWKJACimGPTiUydLtNE_NA?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=846s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;14:06&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga classes are free and open to the public, and teachers get paid, but the class is open to them. They run classes in spring and fall on their rooftop in the summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They also have a partnership with the library, and they have daily meditations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to connect with your students.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/S0y1ZWWKJACimGPTiUydLtNE_NA?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=973s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;16:12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Every day it was a way to jump on and connect and meditate for five minutes. She would send voice classes to a student.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Some students needed a morning stretch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yoga Party at the American playground in 2020.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/S0y1ZWWKJACimGPTiUydLtNE_NA?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1108s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;18:28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They decided to have an outside yoga party. They decided to do it at the American playground. It's a cute little playground with a basketball court and a playground for the kids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;It was a really sweet New York day, but at the same time, it was a Brooklyn time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Online trainings and courses.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/S0y1ZWWKJACimGPTiUydLtNE_NA?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1234s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;20:34&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Homeschooled was a sweet time for people to come together and be in community with each other. They did three online trainings, including a 200 hour in the fall of 2020 and a hybrid in-person training in fall 2021.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Spring 2021 was a little dicey because of COVID.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teaching yoga online.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/u/S0y1ZWWKJACimGPTiUydLtNE_NA?tab=summary&amp;amp;t=1397s"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;23:16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They would have never gone online before. They have the best teachers in the world, and they are smart and have studied for a long time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Yoga is a funny profession, because teachers get inspired to travel. They love to be together and be with each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;Park yoga was full during COVID-19 because people were working remote. They wanted to be together so badly that they missed each other so badly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight:400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400;"&gt;They took a lot of risks and went outside and rolled the dice to see if it would work. It worked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</text>
